Executinga database <em>application</em>, , however, may alter the data stored <em>in</em> itsdatabase back-end, which may not always be desirable for data ... matter what database (original or test) is used, a testgeneration <em>tool</em> has to bridge the semantic gap between databaseapplications and their ... their database back-ends. That is, to comprehen-sively cover a database <em>application</em>, , tests produced for it should notonly provide inputs to ... tests produced for it should notonly provide inputs to the <em>application</em> itself, but also prepare neces-sary states <em>in</em> its database back-end.Mocking techniques [6], and their <em>generalized</em> variant called Pa-rameterized Mock Objects (PMO) [10], can be used ... which responds to actualdatabase queries with either default values (as <em>in</em> mocking tech-niques) or values customized to explore program paths <em>in</em> the appli-cation under test (as <em>in</em> PMO).However, using mock databases is not a silver bullet.

Consequently, running tests with a mock databasemay result <em>in</em> <br> warnings being <em>generated</em>( (i.e., tests fail <em>in</em> test execution but should not <em>in</em> reality; see Section3 for an example).<em>In</em> this paper, we address the preceding challenges and presentan automatic ... paper, we address the preceding challenges and presentan automatic test <em>generation</em> approach for database applications.Given a database <em>application</em> and the schema defining its databaseback-end, our approach produces a ... at the same time, captures thebehavior of the database back-end. <em>In</em> particular, such a mockdatabase replicates the effect of operations over ... produced, our approach uses DynamicSymbolic Execution (DSE) [5, 7] to <em>generate</em> inputs for testing thetarget database <em>application</em>. .

The execu-tion of the <em>application</em> with symbolic inputs, as well as the subse-quent solving of ... constraints collected during symbolic execu-tion, helps to explore program paths <em>in</em> the <em>application</em> ... that are notcovered by random inputs.We have implemented a prototype <em>tool</em>, , called MODA (MockObject Based Test <em>Generation</em> for Database <em>Applications</em>) ), for ourapproach. <em>In</em> its current implementation, MODA incorporatesPex [9], a <em>tool</em> from Microsoft Research, as its DSE engine.

Tomake Pex work with a mock database, our <em>tool</em> equips it with twocapabilities: (1) a code transformation feature that ... a real-world medical device and theother on an open source <em>software</em> <em>system</em>. .

APPROACHGiven a database <em>application</em> and the schema of its databaseback-end, MODA coordinates four of ... its databaseback-end, MODA coordinates four of its components, namelyMock Object <em>Framework</em>, , Code Transformer, Test <em>Generator</em>, , andTest Transformer, to produce a test <em>suite</em> that systematically exer-cises the target application.Figure 1 presents an architectural ... 1 presents an architectural view of MODA, where theMock Object <em>Framework</em> component establishes a mock databasethat simulates the database back-end and ... the database back-end and the Code Transformercomponent pre-processes the target <em>application</em> such that all of itsdatabase interactions are replaced by interactions ... interactions are replaced by interactions with the mockdatabase. The Test <em>Generator</em> component of MODA serves asthe engine for <em>generating</em> tests for any user-selected method inthe target <em>application</em>, , while the Test Transformer component post-processes the <em>generated</em> tests to make them runnable with the targetapplication.2.1 Mock Object ... its database back-end accomplishes the following functions: organizes and maintainsdata <em>in</em> a specified structure; provides interfaces through whichthe <em>application</em> ... can interact with it; and responds to queries issuedfrom the <em>application</em> by performing appropriate operations over thestored data.

For eachtype of query, the Mock Object <em>Framework</em> component includes amocking algorithm to simulate its effects.As an example, ... table that the query targets, Cis a subset of columns <em>in</em> T , V ={v1, v2, ..., vn} are the list ... ={v1, v2, ..., vn} are the list of val-ues defined <em>in</em> the V ALUE clause of the query, and |C| = ... and |C| = |V |.The component mocks an INSERT operation <em>in</em> a straightfor-ward manner: the table with the name T is ... the standard relationaldatabase schemas [13].2902.2 Code TransformerGiven a target database <em>application</em> P , the Code Transformercomponent redirects it to interact with ... to interact with the mock database createdby the Mock Object <em>Framework</em>. .

Such targets, which ... to the target. Such targets, which can be lines orbranches <em>in</em> the <em>application</em> code, arise <em>in</em> a number of differ-ent scenarios, as discussed <em>in</em> Section 1. The UI model couldbe specified manually or <em>generated</em> automatically throughone of the model <em>generation</em> techniques proposed <em>in</em> the lit-erature (see Section 8).The motivating example <em>in</em> Section 2 demonstrates thatreaching a target <em>generally</em> requires execution of a series ofevent handlers that mutate the ... state, sometimesbased on strings or numbers provided by the user <em>in</em> the formof event parameters, and navigation between these eventhandlers, ultimately ... ultimately executing the event handler that con-tains the target. More <em>generally</em>, , our study of Android ap-plications suggests that executions exercising ... <br> ... that consider different aspects ofhow execution of event handlers affect <em>application</em> state.• We provide an experimental evaluation involving fiveAndroid <em>applications</em>. .

As mechanism to support this task <em>in</em> <em>software</em> projects, there are several commercial and opensource <em>tools</em> available to <em>automate</em> <em>tests</em> for web-based <em>applications</em>, , such as Watir [4], Canoo WebTest [5], JMeter [6], ... WebTest [5], JMeter [6], Selenium [7], amongst others. The Selenium <em>framework</em> is considered the most popular opensource functional test <em>tool</em> for web-based <em>applications</em> [7]. Selenium comprises a set of <em>tools</em> to support the development of <em>automated</em> <em>tests</em> scripts for web-based <em>applications</em>. .

Spreadsheet languages, which include commercial spreadsheets and various research systems, have had a substantial impact on end-user computing. Research shows, however, that spreadsheets often contain faults. Thus, in previous work we presented a methodology that helps spreadsheet users test their spreadsheet formulas. Our empirical studies have shown that end users ...

<strong>Abstract</strong>:<br>
<em>Automated</em> <em>tests</em> can play a key role <em>in</em> ensuring <em>system</em> quality <em>in</em> <em>software</em> development. However, significant problems arise <em>in</em> <em>automating</em> <em>tests</em> of stochastic algorithms. Normally, developers write tests that simply check ... (perhaps within some tolerance). But for stochastic algorithms, restricting ourselves <em>in</em> this way severely limits the kinds of tests we can ... that rely on a particular seed for a random number <em>generator</em>. . A richer and more powerful set of tests is ... results of running an algorithm many times. The work described <em>in</em> this paper has been done <em>in</em> the context of a real-world <em>application</em>, , a large-scale simulation of urban development designed to inform ... use and transportation. We describe our earlier experience with using <em>automated</em> <em>testing</em> for this <em>system</em>, , <em>in</em> which we took a conventional approach, and the resulting difficulties. ... cover the most commonly used distributions.

We found that ... the same time. We found that the available commercial testing <em>tools</em> support only one mobile phone at a time and therefore ... and therefore they do not efficiently support testing of B3G <em>applications</em>. <br>
