abstract={Recently, considerable researches on wireless networks have been carried in industrial automation. A great deal of wireless control and monitoring systems are introduced in certain problematic parts of the process industry to improve the productivity and efficiency. However, the control and monitor application requires high standard performances, such as reliability, real-timing and accuracy. Therefore a comprehensive performance assessment is needed to test the property of the wireless network so as to optimize the network protocol and improve the network communication quality. This paper studies the wireless network in the integrated wired/wireless fieldbus system and proposes a method to acquire a set of key indicators of wireless networks. Then, a test device is designed to acquire the performance indicators of the system. The wireless protocols are analysed according to the performance indicators. The results show that the test for the performance of wireless networks can be realized by the method mentioned.},

abstract={A method of dry resistance load test of diesel locomotive is introduced. The electric power generated by a dynamotor, which is driven by the diesel, is converted to DC and consumed on the dry resistances. As the heat dissipation of the resistances is about several thousand kilowatts, DC motor fans are used for air cooling the resistances. In order to save energy, the energy for driven the motor fans is come from the electric power of the DC power. A constant current speed regulating system for the motor fans is presented, which bases on a kind of high-power switch component (IGBT). The experimental results are discussed.},

pages={78-85}, 
abstract={State-of-the-art digital ASICs have even faster clock rates and signal transition times; testing these devices may cause problems regarding delivering the signals to the device under test (DUT) and precisely measuring the response of the DUT. Transmission-line techniques have to be applied to the tester-to-DUT interconnection in order to maintain signal fidelity. The author illustrates how to implement this critical signal path in a high-speed test system to get high-precision timing and level measurements, particularly for CMOS devices. The solution suggested to embed a CMOS device in a transmission-line environment is the resistive divider. The operating principle of the resistive divider is to apply a definable DC load to the DUT. This maintains signal fidelity, as the signal is fed into a parallel terminated system. Therefore no reflections occur},

abstract={Wide area measurements are becoming the norm of power system monitoring, protection and control. Frequency monitoring network (FNET) is a low-cost, easily deployable system at 120V distribution level. The frequency disturbance recorder (FDR) is actually a single-phase phasor measurement unit (PMU) in the sense that it measures the voltage phase angle, amplitude, and frequency from a single-phase voltage source. This paper discussed a calibrating and dynamic testing procedure developed for assuring the quality and accuracy of FDRs. Voltage magnitude and angle are calibrated, and two types of dynamic performance test, step and ramp, are performed for verifying the dynamic performance of FDRs. A detailed FDR calibrating and testing case is given. The test results demonstrate that the quality and accuracy of FDRs can satisfy the requirement of wide area measurement system.},

abstract={We describe our experience of training a remotely located team of developers and testers to prepare and execute performance tests. The team is located in India. The lead performance engineer and the test project manager are based in New Jersey. The team members had little or no prior experience of performance testing. We describe how we overcame cultural differences and a large time difference to develop a performance testing team that is now functioning well with far less supervision than was required at its inception. Cultural differences included contrasting views on adherence to strict laboratory procedures and assumptions about the prior knowledge, experience, and expectations of working habits of the India-based and New Jersey-based teams. We show how these differences and organizational challenges were overcome with intensive on-site training, the use of twice-daily scrum meetings, the careful designation of team leaders and role players at the remote testing site, and, eventually, the development intensive use of automated tools to execute performance tests and track the results.},

abstract={The effects of dipyridamole and dipyridamole induced ischemia on the traditional spectral parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were investigated in normal and coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, who underwent a dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET). The relevant spectral parameters (LF and NF powers, LF/HF ratio) were monitored on a beat-to-beat basis and their variations were linked to the different test epochs and the different pathological events as detected by echocardiographic and electrocardiographic changes. A recursive least square (RLS) identification algorithm was used to this purpose, which is able to track the dynamical changes in nonstationary signals. Spectral parameters were obtained by means of a pole-tracking algorithm which fulfils an efficient extraction of these parameters on a beat-to-beat basis. The estimated parameters allow one, to achieve more information on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) status during drug infusion and the correspondence with the induced ischemia},

pages={609-612}, 
abstract={One of the biggest challenges today with Pre-silicon System-on-Chip verification is to stress out the SoC to uncover as many corner case design issues by injecting heavy real time data traffic into the system. The inherent efficiency and the performance of the Emulation and FPGA prototyping systems make them the ideal platforms to run these tests. A typical solution is to inject data traffic through protocol exercisers with proprietary hardware (vendor specific slow down solutions) which can bridge the emulated DUT with a real time device or use software API's with transaction based SCE-MI communication infrastructure. The need for a complex input output interface makes the former difficult to be used with all emulators / FPGA prototyping systems while SCE-MI communication infrastructure being protocol specific is a disadvantage. So, a synthesizable verification architecture compliant with SCE-MI 2.0 infrastructure through which the protocol specific traffic is injected through industry standard interfaces. i.e. PIPE (PCIe), UTMI (USB), MII (Ethernet) based on user configured stimuli has been designed and implemented. Being synthesizable, the verification environment can run in both emulation and prototyping platforms effectively stress testing the complete system.},
