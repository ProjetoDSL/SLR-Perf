abstract={Full load back-to-back test of VSDS's (Variable Speed Drive Systems) are sometimes required for oil and gas projects. VSI (Voltage Source Inverter) technology is becoming the drive system of choice for super large compressor drives, up to 100 MW. Special consideration /facilities are necessary to perform back-to- back tests for VSDS driven by VSI, because the type of converter used for such large VSI's is usually a diode rectifier without regenerative capability. To realize a back-to-back test for this type of VSDS, a VSI with regenerative converter, (usually adopting PWM converter topology), is necessary. But it is a heavy burden to prepare such super large VSI with regeneration capability purely as a test facility. This paper proposes a test method to increase the load test capacity of a back-to-back test facility up to two times the regenerative converter capacity. This idea is to apply a VSI with regenerative converter as a soft starter during start-up of back-to-back connected motor and generator system and as a constant voltage and constant frequency power supply during testing of VSDS. The proposed test facility is configured by direct connection of the load machine output to the input transformer of tested VSDS to circulate the load power directly. Only loss power and reactive power is supplied by VSI with regenerative converter.},

abstract={Service applications are applicable to provide services for requests of users from network. Due to the fact that they have to endure a big number of concurrent requests, the performance of service applications running under specific arrival rate of requests should be assessed. To measure the performance of a service application, multi-party testing context is needed to simulate a number of concurrent requests and collect the responses. TTCN-3 is a test description language; it provides basic language elements for multi-party testing context that can be used in performance tests. This paper proposes a general approach of using TTCN-3 in multi-party performance testing service application. To this aim, a model of service application is presented, and performance testing framework for service applications is discussed. This testing framework is realized for a typical application by developing a reusable TTCN-3 abstract test suite.},

The designed system will open one or combination of the nozzles of the spraying system since the plant height is identified. To address the plant height-adaptive challenge, a pesticide spraying system with plant height-adaptive is proposed based on a camera sensor to dealt with the figure of the plant.

title={A Genetic Algorithm-Based Stress Test Requirements Generator Tool and Its Empirical Evaluation}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={36}, 
number={6}, 
pages={778-797}, 
abstract={Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied previously to UML-driven stress test requirements generation with the aim of increasing chances of discovering faults relating to network traffic in distributed real-time systems. However, since evolutionary algorithms are heuristic, their performance can vary across multiple executions, which may affect robustness and scalability. To address this, we present the design and technical detail of a UML-driven, GA-based stress test requirements generation tool, together with its empirical analysis. The main goal is to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness and also to validate the design choices of the GA used in the tool. Findings of the empirical evaluation reveal that the tool is robust and reasonably scalable when it is executed on large-scale experimental design models. The study also reveals the main bottlenecks and limitations of the tools, e.g., there is a performance bottleneck when the system under test has a large number of sequence diagrams which could be triggered independently from each other. In addition, issues specific to stress testing, e.g., the impact of variations in task arrival pattern types, reveal that the tool generally generates effective test requirements, although the features of those test requirements might be different in different runs (e.g., different stress times from the test start time might be chosen). While the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate software test cases has been widely reported, the extent, depth, and detail of the empirical findings presented in this paper are novel and suggest that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in generating stress test requirements. It is hoped that the findings of this empirical study will help other SBSE researchers with the empirical evaluation of their own techniques and tools.},

abstract={This paper addresses an innovative solution to develop a circuit to perform accelerated stress tests of capacitive microelectromechanical-system (MEMS) switches and shows the use of instruments and equipment to monitor physical aging phenomena. A dedicated test circuit was designed and fabricated in order to meet the need for accelerated techniques for those structures. It integrated an in-house miniaturized circuit connected to additional test equipment (e.g., oscilloscopes and capacitance meters) that enabled the reliability characterization of capacitive switches. The accelerated stress test (AST) circuit generated an electrostatic-discharge-like impulse that stressed the device. This setup allowed the simultaneous measurement of the current and voltage waveforms, and the capacitance variation of the device under test after each stress. The results obtained using the miniature AST circuit were discussed and were correlated with results obtained using a commercial human-body-model tester as well as data from a cycling benchmark. The scope of this paper encompasses the theory, methodology, and practice of measurement; the development of a testing miniaturized board; and the analysis and representation of the information obtained from a set of measurements. As a result, it may contribute to the scientific and technical standards in the field of instrumentation and measurement of electrostactically actuated devices having insulating layers.},

abstract={The purpose of locomotive load test is to examine and adjust the capability of locomotive often in its non-driving state, and it is a kind of important standard and means to estimate the quality of repairing locomotive in railway locomotive depot. There are two ways of load test at present. One is the water-resistor load test, the other is the dry resistor load test. Because the dry resistor-load test means does not pollute the environment and needs area less, its developing foreground is immense. To solve the difficulty that the current cannot be freely regulated continuously, for the first time, the model of weightier resistor network in digital circuit is applied to the locomotive dry resistor-load test system, which solves the problem of dry resistor-load test theoretically. It is proved by theory and test that the precision of dry resistor means can meet the request of locomotives constant power load test and reach the standard of water-resistor, so it can serve the application of the dry resistor-load test system. During the locomotive load test, the load of locomotive may be regulated so that the locomotive can be adapted run on all kinds of actual work state. According to the characteristic of weightier resistor, the control arithmetic, which is made up of fuzzy algorithm and binary algorithm, realizes the fast and exact regulation on locomotive load. This paper introduces how to apply fuzzy and binary algorithm to regulate the dry resistor-load and explains the realization of the fuzzy and binary algorithm.},

abstract={In this work, a compact-type megasonic cleaning system for semiconductor manufacturing was developed and its performance was verified. To design this megasonic system, firstly, an impedance analysis for a quartz megasonic waveguide with the piezoelectric actuator was performed with finite element method (FEM) software ANSYS. The obtained peak value of the anti-resonance frequency was 983 kHz, which showed good agreement with the design value of 982 kHz. In addition, acoustic pressures of the developed system was assessed by measuring acoustic pressures and comparing standard deviation values of them with a conventional megasonic system to evaluate the system performance. The analysis results showed that the standard deviation of the developed system was decreased by 38% compared to the commercial system. For another evaluation, the particle removal efficiency (PRE) test was performed with 80 nm particles. The experimental result revealed that the system has PRE of 91%. Based on the results, the developed megasonic system is regarded as an improved cleaning system which can irradiate more uniform acoustic pressures. As a consequence, it is thought to have higher energy efficiency and save the consumption of chemical and ultra pure water (UPW) in nano-particle cleaning.},

abstract={Processor stress test utilities are important tools for a number of different use cases. In particular, cooling systems need to be tested at maximum load in order to ensure that they fulfill their specifications. Additionally, a test system characterization in terms of idle and maximum power consumption is often a prerequisite for energy efficiency research. This creates the need for a simple yet versatile tool that generates near-peak power consumption of compute nodes. While in different research areas tools such as LINPACK and Prime95 are commonly used, these tools are just highly optimized and compute intense routines that solve specific computational problems. As stress test utilities they are unnecessarily hard to use and in many cases unreliable in terms of power consumption maximization. We propose FIRESTARTER, an Open Source tool that is specifically designed to create near-peak power consumption. Our experiments show that this task cannot be achieved with generic high-level language code. We therefore use highly optimized assembly routines that take the specific properties of a given processor microarchitecture into account. A study on four compute nodes with current or last generation x86_64 processors shows that we reliably exceed the power consumption of other stress tests and create very steady power consumption patterns.},

The Sundstrand Model QA3000 Q-Flex design achieves a new level of inertial grade performance while maintaining a competitive market price. The specification for the QA3000, supported by actual performance data, depicts performance characteristics superior in both bias and scale factor. Long term measurements display bias and scale factor repeatability obtained across temperature over a period of three years. These data exhibit improved thermal behavior with reduced errors. Reaction time and radiation data highlight the performance of the hybrid position detector circuit.<>},

abstract={Cascading failures in electric power systems are one of the major causes of large power blackouts. The operators in control centers of electric power systems need an online tool to monitor the risk of cascading failures when transferring large quantities of power over long distances. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stress test model of cascading failures. The stress test model is intended to emulate the effect of security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) in support of the required power transfer level, and at the same time, to account for relay actions in response to a given set of severe disturbances, called maximum credible disturbances. The model includes an inner stage, which simulates cascading outages due to relay actions in the system at a given state under disturbances, and an outer stage, which moves the operating point of the system as the power transfer increases as a result of SCED. We use the stress test model to simulate cascading failures in a real 3000-bus power system when increasing its power transfer level in different directions.},

abstract={Performance issues of OpenFlow switches are attracting a lot of attention owing to the potential large-scale deployment of software-defined devices. This paper presents the OFBench which is an automatic test suite for evaluating the performance of OpenFlow switches. The design, as part of the Automation Control Test System (ACTS) development, is based on a controller-agent architecture which allows the development of test cases that are written in a high-level script language. In addition to the end-to-end measurement methodology, novel methods are proposed to further profile the internal performance metrics, which are difficult to get due to the black-box nature of the device under test. The prototype of this suite currently comprises five test cases to evaluate five performance metrics, which are action time, pipeline time, buffer size, pipeline efficiency, and timeout accuracy. OpenFlow switches are evaluated and three issues are observed associated with switches during the testing. First, some switches may not be well implemented in the design of apply-action instructions. Second, some switches suffer from random crashes with a high volume of bursty packet-in traffic. Finally, the timer of idle-timeout is often not reset properly with matching flow entry.},

abstract={Network storages are used widely in many fields of our society. But their testing performances are not as expected. Most of the tools being used to test the performance of network storage comes from the tools used to test the traditional storage system because the storage devices connected to the net act as the local storage devices. So these tools inevitably miss the effects exerted by the networks which connect the hosts to the storage devices. For example, these tools can hardly generate requests which exceed the maximum loading of storage devices. In this paper, we propose one new method to test the performance of network storage which can easily generate requests that exceed the maximum loading of storage devices. In this method, the test program sends the requests by fixed frequency and the initiator will not be restrained by the targeter when the quantity of requests is close to the maximum load. The load simulated by the new method is more like the load in the real world, especially when the load is very high.},

abstract={This paper presents the technique of how to minimize power from the supply when a three-phase induction motor is under the load test. The load test enables the determination of the value of load power, current and power factor of the induction motor. In practice, a DC generator or eddy current brake is applied for the mechanical test. The objective of this paper is to propose a load test method using two pulleys for changing speed of an induction motor. The second induction machine is controlled to operate as an induction generator in order to transfer the energy to the supply, therefore the power required during the test is obviously reduced. The study of how to control the induction motor operated as generator will be the useful information for developing the induction generator system (IG) to work with variable speed and load, and to make it work as a stand alone generator},

During the load test, analyst strictly monitor and record thousands of performance counters to measure the run time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, network traffic etc. The most frustrating problem faced by analysts is the time spent and complexity involved in analysing these huge counter logs and finding relevant information distributed across thousands of counters. We present our methodology to help analysts by automatically identifying important performance counters for load test and comparing them across tests to find performance gain/loss. Further, our methodology help analysts to understand the root cause of a load test failure by finding previously solved problems in test repositories. A case study on load test data of a large enterprise application shows that our methodology can effectively guide performance analysts to identify and compare top performance counters across tests in limited time thereby archiving 88% counter data reduction.},

It is featured with CAN (Controller Area Network) communication by which the sensor signals and control command signals can be transmitted and received. In the braking performance test of EBS, conventional test methods have some inconvenience in existence. For example, the fixing of pressure sensors and wheel speed sensors is restrained by the installation position, and the precision of measuring is prone to be affected by the environment conditions.

abstract={Nowadays automatic testing is getting more and more important in the telecommunication world. The sooner a fault is discovered the cheaper it is to correct it. If a fault is discovered during the development process the cost of the correction is significantly smaller. There are different test strategies, with different approaches like, conformance test, system test and performance test. The system test takes place after a successful conformance test. Performance test is analyzing the load characteristics of the system under test (SUT). In this article we describe the main attributes of performance testing, where the main challenge is to generate the expected load without having as complex hardware as the SUT is itself. Most of the papers, presented in this subject are focusing on the characteristics of the generated load, but not the way how to achieve it. These papers usually have the assumption that the load can be generated by deploying more hardware resources. Other papers propose new extensions for test description languages such SDL or TTCN-3. In this article we intend to describe a finite state machine (FSM) based model and an algorithm which improves the efficiency of scheduling in this performance test environment. We present an architecture based on the so called virtual threads, an algorithm to optimize the scheduling between these threads, and an example to demonstrate the algorithm.},

In order to stimulate potential failures, the technology of colligating reliability test and life test is studied in the brake system of a certain aircraft, in which the environment stress is not statistical stress but its kind and magnitude are established in allusion to the weak links. Rated working stress which corresponds to antiskid brake rule is brought into the test profile and the contamination tolerance test of hydraulic system is conducted. As a result, latent failures of the break system are activated in a short time; the test which needs 5200 working hours to finish is ended in 200 hours; reliability growth rate achieves 0.65; the MTBF of the brake system increases to 848h from 28h in the beginning, and the first overhaul period of new developed products in the break system attains 1250 takeoff-landing times.},

abstract={The sustained systems performance (SSP) test has been implemented on certain High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) HPC systems in order to quantitatively evaluate updates to system software, hardware repairs, job queuing policy modifications, and revisions to the job scheduler as necessary. The test employs codes used in the system acquisition cycle with proven migration capability to HPCMP HPC systems and non-empirical tests for numerical accuracy. Metrics such as compilation time, queue wait time, benchmark execution time, and total test throughput time are gathered and compared against metric data from previous tests to monitor the systems under test while minimizing impact to the users. Jobs failing to execute properly or in anomalously short or long times are investigated, and the results are reported to system administrators and center directors at each center for appropriate actions. During the past year, the SSP test has been instrumental in surfacing configuration issues with the PBS scheduler and performance issues on several HPC systems. Additionally, the frequency of the SSP test on systems procured in Technology Insertion 2009 (TI-09) and thereafter has increased, with attendant changes in the test cases comprising the test. The SSP test continues to play an important role in monitoring the quality of service delivering HPC to HPCMP users at the system, DoD Supercomputing Resource Center, and vendor levels.},

volume={},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={This paper describes the dynamic monitoring carried out by means of vibration measurements during the standard static load test of a half-through steel arch bridge on the Potenza river. The structural design of the bridge is characterized by some notable aspects: the river crossing is obtained by two coupled steel arches, having a span length around 115 m, and a steel-concrete composite deck sustained by thirty couples of steel hangers; the approaching spans are realized with continuous girders on intermediate supports, having cross section with variable height; the arches are supported on rubber bearing seismic isolators. The vibration measurements were nearly continuously acquired during the loading tests to detect the occurrence of anomalies in the structural behavior. In particular, the global dynamic characteristics of the structure, in terms of modal parameters, were determined using the data set of measurements at specific phases of the load test: first on the unloaded configuration, then on two different loaded configurations and finally after the bridge unloading. Measurements of vibrations due both to the ambient and to the impulse produced by a fully loaded truck passing over a bump, were carried out. The experimental results, in terms of modal parameters of the bridge, are in agreement with the theoretical results obtained with the predictive finite element model developed for design purposes and opportunely modified to account for the real conditions of the bridge during the tests.},

abstract={Three automatic test case generation algorithms intended to test the resource allocation mechanisms of telecommunications software systems are introduced. Although these techniques were specifically designed for testing telecommunications software, they can be used to generate test cases for any software system that is modelable by a Markov chain provided operational profile data can either be collected or estimated. These algorithms have been used successfully to perform load testing for several real industrial software systems. Experience generating test suites for five such systems is presented. Early experience with the algorithms indicate that they are highly effective at detecting subtle faults that would have been likely to be missed if load testing had been done in the more traditional way, using hand-crafted test cases. A domain-based reliability measure is applied to systems after the load testing algorithms have been used to generate test data. Data are presented for the same five industrial telecommunications systems in order to track the reliability as a function of the degree of system degradation experienced},

A very reliable method is presented, especially designed for noisy ECG signals; in this method several thresholds are generated, based on the history of the successive cycles; thresholds for the amplitude of high pass filtered ECG signals and their first derivatives are generated in an adaptive and stable way.

An iterative procedure was used to match the calculated terminal voltage with the test value, for a given armature current and power factor.

abstract={Wireless vehicular communication is, in contrast to other terrestrial types of wireless communications, more dynamic in nature. Both the transmitter and the receiver are moving at high speeds relative to each other, which generates highly dynamic wireless channels. Such channels are characterized by short stationarity regions and large Doppler spreads. Modem manufacturers face a challenge when designing and implementing equipment for such environments. Similarly, for testing and evaluation real-life measurements with vehicles are required, which often is an expensive and slow process. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a method for stress testing transceivers based on the design and implementation of a real-time wireless channel emulator for wireless vehicular communications using a software defined radio (SDR). The emulator together with the proposed test methodology enable quick on-bench evaluation of wireless modems. In the paper we also apply the test on two different IEEE 802.11p modem implementations and characterize the packet error rate performance for different Doppler-delay combinations.},

abstract={Many industrial branches refer to officially defined standards or recommendations concerning their products. Companies of automotive industry, however, define their own technical requirements. As a consequence technical issues like quality of voltage in vehicle power supply systems are different between the companies. A test generator coping with the requirements of most automotive companies at the same time is not available in the market so far. Consequently automotive suppliers use different test equipment depending on the respective customer. A power function generator for testing of 12 V and 42 V components was developed as a co-operation project between university and industry. The generator is able to feed supply currents of 30 A. The output voltage shape can be defined with a high degree of freedom and is repeated cyclically. Voltage rise times of 3 μs and short time voltage drops and/or voltage interrupts can be produced. Of course, slow rise and decrease of the voltage can be realized as well. Additional oscillations of 100 kHz can be superposed to the output voltage. These features make the "voltage ripple generator" superior to commercial products available on market today.},

For the implementation of three-dimensional navigation using feature points, the presented system takes advantage of a robust image extraction and tracking algorithm, data association, and inertial SLAM filter algorithm.

abstract={In our previous study, we investigated the effects of different packaging materials (silicone and phosphor layer) on the reliability of high power light-emitting diodes (HPLEDs) by highly accelerated stress test (HAST). The experimental results showed that the LED samples' lumen maintenance property might have dependence on the silicone amount in the package. In this paper, we further studied the effect of silicone amount on the lumen maintenance under HAST. Five categories of LED specimens specified by silicone amount were prepared and subjected to an isothermal chamber whose temperature was set at 125 °C. An online testing system was used to monitor and record the light outputs in real time during the experimental process. After 400 hours of aging, the largest attenuating range reached 6.17% and different groups display different degradation behaviors. An exponential decay model was adopted to calculate the decay rate of each lumen maintenance curve. The decay rate differs as the silicone amount inside the package modules changes. This phenomenon is well explained and Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations are carried out to validate the explanation. The interaction effect of both silicone amount and temperature is also found and more researches need to be done for further study.},

abstract={When the poloidal field (PF) magnet power supplies (MPS) of 11 units are operated, max power of 200 MVA is required to achieve long pulse operation of Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR). Motor Generator (MG) system was installed to resolve power shortage because the available grid power is only 100 MVA at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) site. MG system is composed of mechanical devices (stator, rotor, bearings, etc.), power control devices (VVVF, exciter), power facilities (transformers, switchboard, UPS, filter, dynamic brake, etc.), utilities (cooling water pump, heat exchangers, cooling fans, oil circulation pump, mechanical brake, etc.) and control system. MG system supplies power to the PF MPS of 11 units. And we configure the Reactive Power Compensator (RPC) & Harmonic Filter (HF) system to stabilize the MG power system. After installing the MG system, individual tests and dummy coil tests were conducted to determine the safety and performance of MG system. And we completed the commissioning of the MG system by carrying out the superconducting magnet coil load test for 2014 KSTAR experiment. MG system was operated up to 150 MVA of PF MPS with RPC & HF system. And the maximum operating duration was about 100 seconds.

pages={109-114}, 
abstract={Exercise test is a screening test which is used to investigate and diagnosis cardiovascular disease. Measuring Blood Pressure (BP) during exercise test is an important issue. Because an individual experiences a great amount of physical stress and the vital signs should be carefully monitored. Using cuff and barometer leads to low accuracy of measuring BP. Moreover, vessel crush encounters the continuous measurements with crucial limitations. Hence, measuring systolic and diastolic BP values with desired accuracy in a cuff-less approach is of challenges in this context. This could be achieved by using features extracted from ECG and PPG signals. BP is highly correlated with parameters such as PTT and HR, but not necessarily linear. The correlation could be nonlinear, multimode and vague. Therefore, using intelligent approaches could be very effective in such modeling issue. In this context, using Fuzzy Function (FF) technique is proposed in this paper. Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering method instead of the FCM, because of considering correlation between data points, and MARS, due to its great ability in multimode and nonlinear modeling, are used to produce the antecedent and consequence of the rules respectively. GK-MARS structure, especially in cases with limited datasets as this study, could be very effective. In order to evaluation, the performance of this structure in BP estimation is compared with other intelligent methods including GRNN, fuzzy systems based on GD and RLS training methods and other structures of FF. Results indicate better performance of FF with GK-MARS structure in satisfying AAMI (SP10) standard in systolic and diastolic BP estimation of all stages.},

IPv6 is more and more emphasized and moving from the pilot phase to the practical application. In the process of deploying IPv6, performance is one of the key issues to be considered. Test is an effective method to understand IPv6 network performance. We need scalable and available tools to measure IPv6 network performance, but the few existing network performance test software support IPv6. So through the introduction of multi-agent technology, a distributed IPv6 network performance test model integrated with centralized control is proposed. We describe architecture and workflow of the model thoroughly, and a IPv6 network performance test system is designed and implemented based on the model. Finally, using our system, we measure IPv6 performance metrics on CERNET2 which is the largest pure IPv6 network in the world presently. The final experiments show that it is necessary to implement a IPv6 network performance test system and that our system is scalable and available for IPv6 network performance test.},

abstract={During the development of high-performance processors, software performance models are used to obtain performance estimates. These models are not cycle-accurate, so their results can have significant errors, leading to performance surprises after the hardware is built. Some performance tests can run directly on the logic simulators, to get more accurate results, but those simulators cannot run large interactive workloads with I/O and much operating system code. So the accurate performance estimates from logic simulators are only available for application code, and are not adequate for the evaluation of powerful server systems that are primarily intended to run large interactive workloads. We discuss a software tool system, the "Reverse Tracer", that generates executable performance tests from an instruction trace of the workload. The generated performance tests retain the essential performance characteristics of multi-user I/O-intensive workloads without doing any real I/O, so they can run in logic simulation to measure performance accurately before the hardware is built.},

abstract={Recently, thanks to development of advanced IoT technology, the disaster prevention service that helps to search and rescue survivors in the disaster site using robots and special equipment is greatly increased. The introduction of these advanced equipments will help to improve rescue operations within golden time and also ensure the safety of firefighters. However, the disaster environment is still very difficult to approach and pass through it due to collapses, obstacles and dangerous materials. In this paper, we design and implement a mobility performance evaluation test-bed which can overcome various risk situations where a robot and special equipment may encounter while driving and passing them. In addition, the test-bed adopts various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in order to quantitatively evaluate the performance. The test-bed is consists of gaps, continuous ramp, crossing ramp, inclined planes, stairs, vertical climbing, narrow passage, pipe passage, water passage and etc. The level of difficulty for each track can be adjusted to provide a basis for the performance rating of the target robots.},

abstract={The on-load tests are carried out on an experimental power system, where the 20 kVA superconducting synchronous generator is connected to the regional power system through reactors (artificial transmission lines). The cooling characteristics of the rotor, especially, the cold damper, are obtained. On the on-load tests, active power vs. reactive power, active power vs. load angle, field current vs. active power characteristics at the constant terminal voltage, and so on are obtained. The transient behavior of the generator for a small variation of the input power is obtained. A transient analysis for the above test was carried out. Good agreement between the measured and calculated values is confirmed. From the results, the characteristics of superconducting generators are compared with those of the conventional ones and discussed.},

abstract={In this paper, a new Kalman filtering technique, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is utilized both experimentally and theoretically as a state estimation tool in field-oriented control (FOC) of sensorless AC drives. Using the advantages of this recent derivative-free nonlinear estimation tool, rotor speed and dq-axis fluxes of an induction motor are estimated only with the sensed stator currents and voltages information. In a previous study, simulations has shown that, UKF, whose several intrinsic properties suggest its use over EKF in highly nonlinear systems, has highly satisfactory rotor speed and flux estimates, which are the most critical states for FOC. In this new work, those simulation results are supported with experimental results.},

year={2010},

pages={201-210}, 
abstract={Large scale systems (LSS) contain multiple subsystems that interact across multiple nodes in sometimes unforeseen and complicated ways. As a result, pinpointing the subsystems that are the source of performance degradation for a load test in LSS can be frustrating, and might take several hours or even days. This is due to the large volume of performance counter data collected such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption and network traffic, the limited operational knowledge of analysts about all subsystems of an LSS and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in a LSS. We have developed a methodology that automatically ranks the subsystems according to the deviation of their performance in a load test. Our methodology uses performance counter data of a load test to craft performance signatures for the LSS subsystems. Pair-wise correlations among the performance signatures of subsystems within a load test are compared with the corresponding correlations in a baseline test to pinpoint the subsystems responsible for the performance violations. Case studies on load test data obtained from a large telecom system and that of an open source benchmark application show that our approach provides an accuracy of 79% and do not require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate.},
