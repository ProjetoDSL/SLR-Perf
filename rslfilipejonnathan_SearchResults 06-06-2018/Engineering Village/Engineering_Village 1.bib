abstract = {Standard methodologies of heart rate variability analysis and physiological interpretation as a marker of autonomic nervous system condition have been largely published at rest, but not so much during exercise. A methodological framework for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during exercise is proposed, which deals with the non-stationary nature of HRV during exercise, includes respiratory information, and identifies and corrects spectral components related to cardiolocomotor coupling (CC). This is applied to 23 male subjects who underwent different tests: maximal and submaximal, running and cycling; where the ECG, respiratory frequency and oxygen consumption were simultaneously recorded. High-frequency (HF) power results largely modified from estimations with the standard fixed band to those obtained with the proposed methodology. For medium and high levels of exercise and recovery, HF power results in a 20 to 40% increase. When cycling, HF power increases around 40% with respect to running, while CC power is around 20% stronger in running.<br/> &copy; 2017, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {High-performance scientific workflows utilize supercomputers, scientific instruments, and large storage systems. Their executions require fast setup of a small number of dedicated network connections across the geographically distributed facility sites.We present Software-Defined Network (SDN) solutions consisting of site daemons that use dpctl, Floodlight, ONOS, or OpenDaylight controllers to set up these connections. The development of these SDN solutions could be quite disruptive to the infrastructure, while requiring a close coordination among multiple sites; in addition, the large number of possible controller and device combinations to investigate could make the infrastructure unavailable to regular users for extended periods of time. In response, we develop a Virtual Science Network Environment (VSNE) using virtual machines, Mininet, and custom scripts that support the development, testing, and evaluation of SDN solutions, without the constraints and expenses of multi-site physical infrastructures; furthermore, the chosen solutions can be directly transferred to production deployments. By complementing VSNE with a physical testbed, we conduct targeted performance tests of various SDN solutions to help choose the best candidates. In addition, we propose a switching response method to assess the setup times and throughput performances of different SDN solutions, and present experimental results that show their advantages and limitations.<br/> &copy; 2018 ACM. 978-1-4503-6372-3/18/01. . . $15.00.},

abstract = {Performance issues of OpenFlow switches are attracting a lot of attention owing to the potential large-scale deployment of software-defined devices. This paper presents the OFBench which is an automatic test suite for evaluating the performance of OpenFlow switches. The design, as part of the Automation Control Test System (ACTS) development, is based on a controller-agent architecture which allows the development of test cases that are written in a high-level script language. In addition to the end-to-end measurement methodology, novel methods are proposed to further profile the internal performance metrics, which are difficult to get due to the black-box nature of the device under test. The prototype of this suite currently comprises five test cases to evaluate five performance metrics, which are action time, pipeline time, buffer size, pipeline efficiency, and timeout accuracy. OpenFlow switches are evaluated and three issues are observed associated with switches during the testing. First, some switches may not be well implemented in the design of apply-action instructions. Second, some switches suffer from random crashes with a high volume of bursty packet-in traffic. Finally, the timer of idle-timeout is often not reset properly with matching flow entry. IEEE},

abstract = {Software testing is the process of testing, verifying and validating the user's requirements. During whole software development, testing is an ongoing process. Black Box, White Box testing and grey box testing are the three main types of software testing. In Black box testing, user doesn't know intrinsic logics and design of system. In white box testing, Tester knows the intrinsic logic of code. In Grey box testing, Tester has little bit knowledge about the internal structure, code and working of the system. It is commonly used in case of Integration testing. Load testing is the type of testing which helps us to analyze the performance of the system under heavy load or under Zero load. With the help of a automated load Testing Tools, we can do it in better way. The intention for writing this research is to carry out a comparison of four automated load testing tools i.e. Apache JMeter, HP LoadRunner, Microsoft Visual Studio (TFS), Siege based on certain criteria i.e. test scripts generation, plug-in support, result reports, application support and cost. The main focus is to study and analyze these load testing tools and identify which tool is best and more efficient [10]. We assume this comparative analysis can help in selecting the most appropriate tool and motivates the use of open source load testing tools.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nowadays applications need to deal with a large number of concurrent requests. These systems must be stress tested to ensure that they can function correctly under a load. In this context, a research field called Search-based Software Testing has become increasingly important. Most of the search-based test methods are based on single objective optimization. In the case of multi-objective optimization of tests, usually researchers assign different weight values to different objectives and combine them as a single objective. This research paper verifies the use of a multi-objective algorithm in search-based stress testing. The NSGA-II algorithm was implemented in the IAdapter tool using the jMetal framework. IAdapter is a JMeter plugin used for performing search-based stress tests. jMetal is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics. One experiment was conducted to validate the proposed approach. &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {The evolution of cloud-computing imposes many challenges on performance testing and requires not only a different approach and methodology of performance evaluation and analysis, but also specialized tools and frameworks to support such work. In traditional performance testing, typically a single workload was run against a static test configuration. The main metrics derived from such experiments included throughput, response times, and system utilization at steady-state. While this may have been sufficient in the past, where in many cases a single application was run on dedicated hardware, this approach is no longer suitable for cloud-based deployments. Whether private or public cloud, such environments typically host a variety of applications on distributed shared hardware resources, simultaneously accessed by a large number of tenants running heterogeneous workloads. The number of tenants as well as their activity and resource needs dynamically change over time, and the cloud infrastructure reacts to this by reallocating existing or provisioning new resources. Besides metrics such as the number of tenants and overall resource utilization, performance testing in the cloud must be able to answer many more questions: How is the quality of service of a tenant impacted by the constantly changing activity of other tenants? How long does it take the cloud infrastructure to react to changes in demand, and what is the effect on tenants while it does so? How well are service level agreements met? What is the resource consumption of individual tenants? How can global performance metrics on application- and system-level in a distributed system be correlated to an individual tenant's perceived performance? In this paper we present CloudPerf, a performance test framework specifically designed for distributed and dynamic multi-tenant environments, capable of answering all of the above questions, and more. CloudPerf consists of a distributed harness, a protocol-independent load generator and workload modeling framework, an extensible statistics framework with live-monitoring and post-analysis tools, interfaces for cloud deployment operations, and a rich set of both lowlevel as well as high-level workloads from different domains. &copy; 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {In order to make a conventional building more efficient or smarter, systems feedbacks are essential. Such feedbacks can include real-time or logged data from various systems, such as temperature, humidity, lighting and CO2 levels. This is only possible by the use of a network of sensors which report to the building management system. Conventional sensors are limited due to wiring and infrastructure requirements. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) however, eliminates the wiring limitations but still in certain cases require periodical battery changes and maintenance. A suitable solution for WSN limitations is to use different types of ambient energy harvesters to power battery-less sensors or alternatively to charge existing batteries so as to reduce their changing requirements. Such systems are already in place using various energy harvesting techniques. Thermoelectric Generators (TEG) are one of them where the temperature gradient is used to generate electricity which is conditioned and used for WSN powering applications. Researchers in this field often face difficulty in estimating the TEG output at the low-temperature difference as manufacturers' datasheets and performance data are not following the same standards and in most cases cover the high-temperature difference (more than 200C&deg;). This is sufficient for industrial applications but not for WSN systems in the built environment where the temperature difference is much smaller (1-20C&deg; is covered in this study). This paper presents a TEG experimental test setup using a temperature controlled hotplate in order to provide accurate TEG performance data at the low-temperature difference range. &copy; The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.},

abstract = {With increasing concern over the environment and ever stringent emissions regulations, the electric vehicle has been investigated as an alternative form of transportation. However, the electric vehicle suffers from relatively short range and long charging times and consequently has not become an acceptable solution to the automotive consumer. The addition of an internal combustion engine to extend the range of the electric vehicle is one method of exploiting the high efficiency and lack of emissions of the electric vehicle while retaining the range and convenient refuelling times of a conventional gasoline powered vehicle. The term that describes this type of vehicle is a hybrid electric vehicle. Many configurations of hybrid electric vehicles have been designed and implemented, namely the series, parallel and power-split configurations. This paper discusses the modelling and simulation of split plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Modelling methods such as physics-based Resistive Companion Form technique and Bond Graph method are presented with powertrain component and system modelling examples. The modelling and simulation capability of existing tools such as ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) is demonstrated through application examples. Hardware implementation has been done and tested on dyno and real road test. An experimental result has been compared to simulation results. Since power electronics is indispensable in hybrid vehicles, the issue of numerical oscillations in dynamic simulations involving power electronics is briefly addressed. &copy; 2017 The Authors.},

abstract = {Nowadays, in industries, Testing has become one of the important tasks. Testing is necessary for an effective performance of product and software applications. When companies having a mass production of hardware boards, it is necessary to do testing of each and every module of hardware like SPI, UART, GPIO, PWM, ADC, USB, Ethernet. If we do testing manually then it will significantly take more time, which we can be reduced by automation testing. But the solution is not an automation testing because automation testing also requires the same amount of system, for example for 300 boards 300 system is required. The only difference in manual and automation testing is that in automation testing it will require less human effort. Now we are focusing more on developing a solution in which many tests can be done on one single system i.e. for 300 boards only one system is required for testing hence this problem can be solved by Yocto Project. Yocto project have build the tool named Bitbake which is written in Python language, which works on multithreading and scheduling so that simultaneously you can test more boards on a single system. In this paper we did automation testing of GPIO pins using Yocto project.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

Using cloud, it is easy to gather the required load for a particular application by forming clusters. If the required load is coming from different clusters and it is not known quantitatively then the problem of load balancing is raised. The proposed load testing tool avoids the problem of getting unequal loads coming from different clusters by distributing the same amount of load to all the clusters.

abstract = {In recent technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) and Web 2.0, a critical problem arises with respect to storing and processing the large amount of collected data. In this paper we develop and evaluate distributed infrastructures for storing and processing large amount of such data. We present a distributed framework that supports customized deployment of a variety of indexing engines over million-node overlays. The proposed framework provides the appropriate integrated set of tools that allows applications processing large amount of data, to evaluate and test the performance of various application protocols for very large scale deployments (multi million nodes-billions of keys). The key aim is to provide the appropriate environment that contributes in taking decisions regarding the choice of the protocol in storage P2P systems for a variety of big data applications. Using lightweight and efficient collection mechanisms, our system enables real-time registration of multiple measures, integrating support for real-life parameters such as node failure models and recovery strategies. Experiments have been performed at the PlanetLab network and at a typical research laboratory in order to verify scalability and show maximum re-usability of our setup.

abstract = {When the poloidal field (PF) magnet power supplies (MPS) of 11 units are operated, max power of 200 MVA is required to achieve long pulse operation of Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR). Motor Generator (MG) system was installed to resolve power shortage because the available grid power is only 100 MVA at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) site. MG system is composed of mechanical devices (stator, rotor, bearings, etc.), power control devices (VVVF, exciter), power facilities (transformers, switchboard, UPS, filter, dynamic brake, etc.), utilities (cooling water pump, heat exchangers, cooling fans, oil circulation pump, mechanical brake, etc.) and control system. MG system supplies power to the PF MPS of 11 units. And we configure the Reactive Power Compensator (RPC) &amp; Harmonic Filter (HF) system to stabilize the MG power system. After installing the MG system, individual tests and dummy coil tests were conducted to determine the safety and performance of MG system. And we completed the commissioning of the MG system by carrying out the superconducting magnet coil load test for 2014 KSTAR experiment. MG system was operated up to 150 MVA of PF MPS with RPC &amp; HF system. And the maximum operating duration was about 100 seconds.

abstract = {An Android-based smart television (TV) must reliably run its applications in an embedded program environment under diverse hardware resource conditions. Owing to the diverse hardware components used to build numerous TV models, TV simulators are usually not sufficiently high in fidelity to simulate various TV models and thus are only regarded as unreliable alternatives when stress testing such applications. Therefore, even though stress testing on real TV sets is tedious, it is the de facto approach to ensure the reliability of these applications in the industry. In this paper, we study to what extent stress testing of smart TV applications can be fully automated in the industrial environments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has addressed this important question. We summarize the findings collected from ten industrial test engineers who have tested 20 such TV applications in a real production environment. Our study shows that the industry required test automation supports on high-level GUI object controls and status checking, setup of resource conditions, and the interplay between the two. With such supports, 87% of the industrial test specifications of one TV model can be fully automated, and 71.4% of them were found to be fully reusable to test a subsequent TV model with major upgrades of hardware, operating system, and application. It represents a significant improvement with margins of 28% and 38%, respectively, compared with stress testing without such supports. &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Large-scale software systems like Amazon and eBay must be load tested to ensure they can handle hundreds and millions of current requests in the field. Load testing usually lasts for a few hours or even days and generates large volumes of system behavior data (execution logs and counters). This data must be properly analyzed to check whether there are any performance problems in a load test. However, the sheer size of the data prevents effective manual analysis. In addition, unlike functional tests, there is usually no test oracle associated with a load test. To cope with these challenges, there have been many analysis techniques proposed to automatically detect problems in a load test by comparing the behavior of the current test against previous test(s). Unfortunately, none of these techniques compare their performance against each other. In this paper, we have proposed a framework, which evaluates and compares the effectiveness of different test analysis techniques. We have evaluated a total of 23 test analysis techniques using load testing data from three open source systems. Based on our experiments, we have found that all the test analysis techniques can effectively build performance models using data from both buggy or non-buggy tests and flag the performance deviations between them. It is more cost-effective to compare the current test against two recent previous test(s), while using testing data collected under longer sampling intervals (&le; 180 seconds). Among all the test analysis techniques, Control Chart, Descriptive Statistics and Regression Tree yield the best performance. Our evaluation framework and findings can be very useful for load testing practitioners and researchers. To encourage further research on this topic, we have made our testing data publicity available to download. &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

Although the first concern is to keep the user safe, providing a flawless protection, it is crucial to reduce the impact brought on the user's system, preventing him to disable or uninstall the AV solution and thus remaining unprotected. The increased number of malware types/families as well as their complexity generated the need for complicated detection methods, which means a constant evaluation is needed. Because of these reasons, our antimalware laboratory has developed a generic framework for measuring the impact that the AV solutions have on the system they are installed on. This system was designed to be easily configurable, managing the big number of changes that occur every day and fast so that every update released to the users can be tested. Also, this framework is used to test and develop new technologies that improve the performance of our AV product.<br/> &copy; 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The current software testing in the aspects of industrial benefits gradually causes the attention of the domestic financial bank. The innovation of software technology, the increase of software scale and the shortened developing period make the traditional manual testing meeting enormous challenges, while the development of automated testing technology has promoted the progress of the software testing industry. Because of the particularity of financial and banking services, the bank is under an obligation to ensure the quality and reliability of software. Therefore it's vital to test the software. In specific practice, although the powerful third-party testing tools can be used as a solution, it is hard to rely on certain tool to implement automated testing, hence a framework of automated test is required to be introduced for testing, which intends to handle high efficiency and high-quality testing for software automation. This paper proposes a kind of software automation testing framework based on QTP, mainly targeting on the core of the bank, credit, online banking to test the function of the three major operations. The framework is a secondary development based on QTP and mainly for regression testing of software, which integrates techniques including object recognition, data-driven, and keyword-driven technology, checkpoint technology, to proceed business-level testing. The paper expatiated on four issues, which were the test system design, the test standardization, the testing framework design and the testing of the implementation. The practical application shows that the framework can improve the operational efficiency, reduce the test cost, and guarantee the smooth progress of the software automation testing.<br/> &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Load testing is the process of applying ordinary stress to a software system to determine the system performance under normal conditions. In a typical load testing lifecycle, three kinds of service tools are involved: test case recording service tools that make testers easier to generate test cases through a web browsing-like behavior; test case execution service tools that exercise test cases with simulations of a large number of concurrent users; system resource monitoring service tools that provide information of system footprints during the test case executions. However, using these three kinds of service tools one by one to complete a load testing may require extra effort on operating and configuring each service. In this paper, we proposed a framework for composing the three types of service tools as an integrated service for load testing. A raw test case recorded by Badboy tool is automatically converted into an expanded test case that can be executed by JMeter. JMeter and Cacti are then automatically invoked by the framework. The execution time period of JMeter is automatically identified as the input to Cacti for resource monitoring of the system under test. The test report together with system footprints is also automatically generated. In the experimental evaluation, the result shows that the framework significantly save time on operating and configuring the load testing service tools than the traditional approach under a t-test. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis Group.},

Magnetic field of the motor was obtained by finite element simulation and testing, and the output characteristic were studied. The calculated results of magnetic field using the finite element software ANSYS meet the experimental results, and the results show that magnetic flux density achieved 626 mT at the air-gap is 6 mm. Experimental system for testing output characteristics of the moving coil motor was established. Output characteristics testing of moving coil linear motor was conducted. The results show that effective output voltage increases linearly with displacement at constant magnetic field strength, coil length and moving frequency. The slope is the function of coil impedance and external load. Moreover, the output voltage increases at load resistance under conditions of same input voltage at a constant coil displacement. The calculatied natrual frequency is 16.5 Hz. The output current of the motor decreases with the increasing of work frequency away from the system natural frequency, and the efficiency of the system is 20%.<br/>},

abstract = {Before placing a software system into production, it is necessary to guarantee it provides users with a certain level of Quality-of-Service. Intensive performance testing is then necessary to achieve such a level and the tests require an isolated computing environment. Virtualization can therefore play an important role for saving energy costs by reducing the number of servers required to run performance tests and for allowing performance isolation when executing multiple tests in the same computing infrastructure. Load generation is an important component in performance testing as it simulates users interacting with the target application. This paper presents our experience in using a virtualized environment for load generation aimed at performance testing. We measured several performance metrics and varied system load, number of virtual machines per physical resource, and the CPU pinning schema for comparison of virtual and physical machines. The two main findings from our experiments are that physical machines produced steadier and faster response times under heavy load and that the pinning schema is an important aspect when setting up a virtualized environment for load generation. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

GUI-driven application testing is an emergent approach to software testing and plays a key role to assure software quality. This paper first discusses the various methods for testing GUI-driven applications, and then defines a GUI model and formally defines the test case and the test suite. Finally, it proposes a novel automated, distributed and cross-platform testing framework for GUI. Experiments conducted showed that the proposed testing architecture managed to use parallel cross-platform clusters to test heterogeneous applications whose technologies were incompatible with the testing framework. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

However, the performance of python is always a headache for developers. For reasonable selection of functions in base library, the usage of third-party plug-ins functions and methods, and the design of custom functions, the problem whether they are the best choices for general developers is difficult to make a positive answer. After the systems performance bottleneck occurs, it is particularly important to determine where to tune and how to tune. Through the analysis and dynamic tracking of source code, with the built-in method in Python, we can get information about the system to be optimized, included: functions, grammatical structures, running time of each function, the relationship between function calls etc. This information provides an effective basis for further optimization of the system. Experimental results show that the system optimized by the tool has a significantly improvement.<br/>},

The performance requirements for the Event Service are demanding with a goal of over 60 thousand events/second. This service is critical to the success of the TMT software architecture; therefore, a project was started to survey the open source and commercial market for viable software products. A trade study led to the selection of five products for thorough testing using a specially constructed computer/network configuration and test suite.

abstract = {Application stress testing applies the concept of computer network penetration testing to software applications. Since software applications may be attacked - from inside or outside a protected network boundary - they are threatened by actions and conditions which cause delays, disruptions, or failures. Stress testing exposes software systems to simulated cyber attacks, revealing potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in their implementation. By using such testing, these internal weaknesses and vulnerabilities can be discovered earlier in the software development life cycle, corrected prior to deployment, and lead to improved software quality. Application stress testing is a process and software prototype for verifying the quality of software applications under severe operating conditions. Since stress testing is rarely - if at all - performed today, the possibility of deploying critical software systems that have been stress tested provides a much stronger indication of their ability to withstand cyber attacks. Many possible attack vectors against critical software can be verified as true threats and mitigated prior to deployment. This improves software quality and serves as a tremendous risk reduction for critical software systems used in government and commercial enterprises. The software prototype models and verifies failure conditions of a system under test (SUT). The SUT is first executed in a virtual environment and its normal operational modes are observed. A normal behavior model is generated in order to predict failure conditions based on attack models and external SUT interfaces. Using off-the-shelf software tools, the predictions are verified in the virtual environment by stressing the executing SUT with attacks against the SUT. Results are presented to testers and system developers for dispensation or mitigation. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

The popularity of the web created a new environment in which the applications need to be highly scalable due to the data tsunami generated by a huge load of requests (i.e., connections and business operations). In this context, the main question is to validate how far the web applications can deal with the load generated by the clients. Load testing is a technique to analyze the behavior of the system under test upon normal and heavy load conditions. In this work we present a peer-to-peer load testing approach to isolate bottleneck problems related to centralized testing drivers and to scale up the load.

abstract = {Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that revolutionizes the computing landscape by providing on-demand delivery of software, platform, and infrastructure over the Internet. Yet, architecting, deploying, and configuring enterprise applications to run well on modern clouds remains a challenge due to associated complexities and non-trivial implications. The natural and presumably unbiased approach to these questions is thorough testing before moving applications to production settings. However, thorough testing of enterprise applications on modern clouds is cumbersome and error-prone due to a large number of relevant scenarios and difficulties in testing process. We address some of these challenges through Expertus - -a flexible code generation framework for automated performance testing of distributed applications in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Expertus uses a multi-pass compiler approach and leverages template-driven code generation to modularly incorporate different software applications on IaaS clouds. Expertus automatically handles complex configuration dependencies of software applications and significantly reduces human errors associated with manual approaches for software configuration and testing. To date, Expertus has been used to study three distributed applications on five IaaS clouds with over 10,000 different hardware, software, and virtualization configurations. The flexibility and extensibility of Expertus and our own experience on using it shows that new clouds, applications, and software packages can easily be incorporated. &copy; 2012 IEEE.<br/>},

While software testing is expensive and time-consuming, sufficient testing is hard, especially for a distributed system using web services technique in the real circumstance. The development of cloud computing provides us new ideas to solve these testing problems. To address these issues, we propose a framework which integrates cloud computing and performance testing technologies. In this paper, first we present the architecture of the cloud-based performance testing system for web services (CPTS), which is a portable, extensible and easy-to-use framework for generating and submitting test workloads to computing clouds. Then, we show the process how to use CPTS to run a performance test and present the concept of dynamic migration in CPTS. Finally, we present our experiences with CPTS in Amazon EC2. We found that the CPTS allows a user to easily set up and test a web services system on the cloud and improve test effectively. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {The axle is one of the most important components directly relating the safety operation of vehicles. However, the testing method of axle on site used in China is backward and inefficient, while checking failures occur now and then. But the theory of reliability design of fatigue, which has been well developed, is difficult to be applied to the test of axle on site. In recent years, the computing automotive technology is advocated at abroad to solve the complicated problem of how to put the reliability analysis of fatigue into practice. This paper realized the 3D simulation of testing system through the Pro/E software as well as constructed the system, which was based on the trailer axle testing system prototype. The system hardware was comprised of support, guide, sensors, AC servo motor and servo driver; meanwhile, the system software adapted the modularized idea in order to divide the monolithic construction into five parts, including main operation control module and 4 testing modules. Every testing module was constituted by 5 submodules. The system software program was written by LabVIEW. It drove the linkage device by controlling the rotation of the servo motor and loaded the simulated axle through two pressure heads, then the displacement and pressure were collected as feedback through the data acquisition card. The displacement-voltage linear relationship of A/B pressure head was obtained through experiments on displacement sensors before system test. By calibrating the straight-line equation, the result was that the maximum locating relative error is 5.207%, and the absolute value of average relative error was 1.4%. The voltage-load linear relationship of A/B pressure head was obtained by accurate positioning of load. Analyzed by software SPSS, in the equation of the load stress and voltage linear regression, the result was that R &gt; 0.994, Sig. &lt; 0.05, thus regression was significant. According the constructed testing system, the performance of fatigue, stiffness, strength, and stress of the simulated axle were tested and analyzed. In fatigue test, flaw occurred after 821 times vibration and efficacy was lost after 1067 times vibration; in stiffness test, spot D almost stayed unchanged and the displacements of spot C and E ranged from 60 to 63 mm; in strength test, the maximum displacement of sensor E was 66.622 mm; in stress test, the maximum displacement of spot E was 66.751 mm, and the maximum stress was 259.444 MPa. The system was steady. The simulated test had been lasting for one month and no bug was found. Therefore, the result generally meets the project requirement.},

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges today with Pre-silicon System-on-Chip verification is to stress out the SoC to uncover as many corner case design issues by injecting heavy real time data traffic into the system. The inherent efficiency and the performance of the Emulation and FPGA prototyping systems make them the ideal platforms to run these tests. A typical solution is to inject data traffic through protocol exercisers with proprietary hardware (vendor specific slow down solutions) which can bridge the emulated DUT with a real time device or use software API's with transaction based SCE-MI communication infrastructure. The need for a complex input output interface makes the former difficult to be used with all emulators / FPGA prototyping systems while SCE-MI communication infrastructure being protocol specific is a disadvantage. So, a synthesizable verification architecture compliant with SCE-MI 2.0 infrastructure through which the protocol specific traffic is injected through industry standard interfaces. i.e. PIPE (PCIe), UTMI (USB), MII (Ethernet) based on user configured stimuli has been designed and implemented. Being synthesizable, the verification environment can run in both emulation and prototyping platforms effectively stress testing the complete system. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

To test the peak recording speed, the test methods combining hardware with software based on climbing search algorithm and speed dichotomy was praser. The hardware data generator was designed, whose speed was software adjustable according to valid data duty cycle mechanism. Climbing search algorithm rough determined the peak recording speed range, and then the speed dichotomy approached the peak recording speed; the test report was transferred to PC for display through the serial port and Gigabit Ethernet. Experimental results show that the speed load regulation accuracy is up to 0.1 MB/s; the speed load range is from 0 to 1600 MB/s; verification of read back data using hardware has no clock delay; the tested NAND Flash recorder connecting with 8 SLC NAND Flash chips has the peak recording speed of 240.12 MB/s; under the speed load 200 MB/s, the NAND Flash record controller can work well continuously for more than 24 h.

abstract = {Recently, enterprises, organizations, and software companies are building more and more web applications to provide their services over the Internet. In order to fulfill various requirements, the complexity of web applications nowadays is increasing dramatically. As a result, the performance characteristics of web applications, including response time, throughput, etc, become more critical than before and should be taken into careful consideration. If the response time of a web application is poor, users may lose their interests even the function of the web application is correct. Therefore, how to execute performance testing on a complex web application systematically and efficiently will be an important issue. In this paper, a performance testing framework for REST-based web applications is introduced. The performance testing framework aims to provide software testers with an integrated process from test cases design, test scripts generation, to test execution. Based on the test cases designed by software testers and the appropriate software artifacts preserved by the framework (e.g., API document), the framework generates the corresponding performance test scripts, which can be executed by specific performance test tools. This helps software testers to focus more in the design of performance test cases. In addition, effort needed to understand the design and implementation of the application and to learn the operation of testing tools decrease. Thus, the efficiency of performance testing can be highly facilitated. &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Distributed analysis of LHC data is an I/O-intensive activity which places large demands on the internal network, storage, and local disks at remote computing facilities. Commissioning and maintaining a site to provide an efficient distributed analysis service is therefore a challenge which can be aided by tools to help evaluate a variety of infrastructure designs and configurations. HammerCloud is one such tool; it is a stress testing service which is used by central operations teams, regional coordinators, and local site admins to (a) submit arbitrary number of analysis jobs to a number of sites, (b) maintain at a steady-state a predefined number of jobs running at the sites under test, (c) produce web-based reports summarizing the efficiency and performance of the sites under test, and (d) present a web-interface for historical test results to both evaluate progress and compare sites. HammerCloud was built around the distributed analysis framework Ganga, exploiting its API for grid job management. HammerCloud has been employed by the ATLAS experiment for continuous testing of many sites worldwide, and also during large scale computing challenges such as STEP'09 and UAT'09, where the scale of the tests exceeded 10,000 concurrently running and 1,000,000 total jobs over multi-day periods. In addition, HammerCloud is being adopted by the CMS experiment; the plugin structure of HammerCloud allows the execution of CMS jobs using their official tool (CRAB).<br/>},

Object-oriented and concept-based software design techniques were adopted to integrate the pile load test database into the system. A total of 673 case histories of pile load test were included in the database. The data consisted of drilled shaft and driven precast concrete pile axial load tests in drained, undrained, and gravel loading conditions as well as pre-analyzed data and back-calculated design parameters. Unified modeling language, a standard software design tool, was utilized to design the WBPLT system architecture with five major concept-based components. These components provide the static structure and dynamic behavior of system message flows in a visualized manner. The open-source Apache Web server is the building block of the WBPLT system, and PHP Web programming language implements the operation of the WBPLT components, particularly the automatic translation of user query into structured query language. A simple search and inexpensive query can be implemented through the Internet browser. The pile load test database is helpful, and data can be easily retrieved and utilized worldwide for research and advanced applications. &copy; 2014 Techno-Press, Ltd.<br/>},

One of most important limitations of this technology is the large computational requirements involved in data processing. Several software solutions for data processing are available in the market, but users are often unknown about the methodologies to verify their performance accurately. In this work a methodology for LiDAR software performance testing is presented and six different suites are studied: QT Modeler, AutoCAD Civil 3D, Mars 7, Fledermaus, Carlson and TopoDOT (all of them in x64). Results depict as QTModeler, TopoDOT and AutoCAD Civil 3D allow the loading of large datasets, while Fledermaus, Mars7 and Carlson do not achieve these powerful performance. AutoCAD Civil 3D needs large loading time in comparison with the most powerful softwares such as QTModeler and TopoDOT. Carlson suite depicts the poorest results among all the softwares under study, where point clouds larger than 5 million points cannot be loaded and loading time is very large in comparison with the other suites even for the smaller datasets. AutoCAD Civil 3D, Carlson and TopoDOT show more threads than other softwares like QTModeler, Mars7 and Fledermaus. &copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we are going to introduce the problem of assigning test components to hosts of a performance (or load) testing environment, and its two novel solutions. When testing the performance of a device (System Under Test - SUT), the test environment simulates the latter real-life environment of the SUT. The number of hosts in the test environment is however way less than the number of hosts the SUT will have to serve in its real-life environment. Thus, real-life hosts are simulated by software entities, the so-called test components that have to be optimally assigned and then executed on the hosts of the test environment (testing hosts). Our goal is to emulate all the test components by as few testing hosts as possible, that is, to maximize the load on the testing hosts. The problem to be solved is a special case of the task assignment problem for which many solutions have been developed. Our solutions presented in this paper are, however, optimized for distributing load testing traffic. Thus the possibilities and restrictions we had to take into account are very different from those of the classical task assignment case. One of the solutions we present extends existing bin packing heuristics, while the other one solves a series of integer linear programs to make the assignments. Our simulations have shown that by applying our solutions, the average load level on testing hosts can be significantly increased.<br/>},

abstract = {Neutral beam injection (NBI) system is a workhorse to heat magnetically confined tokamak fusion plasma. The heart of any NBI system is an ion extractor system. Steady State Superconducting Tokamak-1 (SST-1) needs 0.5 MW of hydrogen beam power at 30 kV to raise the plasma ion temperature to &sim;1 keV and 1.7 MW of hydrogen beam power at 55 kV for future upgradation. To meet this requirement, an ion extractor system consisting of three actively cooled grids has been designed, fabricated, and its performance test has been done at MARION test stand, IPP, Julich, Germany. During long pulse (14 s) operation, hydrogen ion beam of energy 31 MJ has been extracted at 41 kV. In this paper, we have presented detailed analysis of calorimetric data of actively cooled extractor grids and showed that by monitoring outlet water temperature, grid material temperature can be monitored for safe steady state operation of a NBI system. Steady state operation of NBI is the present day interest of fusion research.

abstract = {Methods of pure performance testing or single analytical modeling, such as queueing network model, etc, have their limitation on the accuracy of performance indexes measurement, the validity of performance forecasting, and the controlling of testing iteration due to the complexity of Web systems. A Web performance modeling framework supporting mixed performance modeling is proposed. It uses different performance modeling methods for different kinds of performance indexes to derive closed form functions and their hypothesis of measurement. The regression analysis and testing are used on the training data to estimate the parameters of the closed form functions. To demonstrate the feasibility and validity of this framework, a real-world Web community system (igroot.com) is studied under the framework. For the indexes of system response time and scalability, a mixed modeling method is proposed by combining queueing network reduction and extended universal scalability model US-&gamma;. Compared with other practical system performance testing methods, such as universal scalability model US, the model accuracy of performance forecasting is greatly improved and the cost of software and hardware used in the process is greatly reduced. The error rate of estimated response time is within 4 percent, the error rate of estimated throughout saturation point is within 1 percent, and the error rate of estimated infimum of buckle point is within 5 percent. Correlating the scalability model and threads data of the Web server, an HTTP processing bottleneck at the architecture level is identified.<br/>},

Due to the fact that they have to endure a big number of concurrent requests, the performance of service applications running under specific arrival rate of requests should be assessed. To measure the performance of a service application, Multi-party testing context is needed to simulate a number of concurrent requests and collect the responses. TTCN-3 is a test description language; it provides basic language elements for multi-party testing context that can be used in performance tests. This paper proposes a general approach of using TTCN-3 in multiparty performance testing service application. To this aim, a model of service application is presented, and performance testing framework for service applications is discussed. This testing framework is realized for a typical application by developing a reusable TTCN-3 abstract test suite. &copy; 2009 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce two major problems from the field of load (or performance) testing and our solutions for them. When testing the performance of a device (System Under Test - SUT), the test environment executes many software entities (the so-called test components) on the hosts of the test environment (testing hosts). Our goal is to maximize the load on the testing hosts by assigning the test components to them closely to optimal. The first problem to be solved is, thus, a special case of the task assignment problem for which many algorithms have been developed. Our solutions presented in this paper are, however, optimized for distributing load testing traffic in the case of which the possibilities and restrictions to be taken into account are very different from those of the classical task assignment case. The other problem we deal with is how to schedule test components running on the same testing host. Most of the papers written on scheduling focus on the characteristics of the generated load, but not on the way of generating it. These papers usually assume that the load can be generated by improving hardware resources. In this paper, however, we introduce a model and an algorithm which improves the efficiency of scheduling in a load testing environment with way less hardware resources. The algorithm is based on our novel concept of virtual threads. Our simulations have shown that by applying our solutions, the efficiency of load testing can be significantly increased. &copy; Periodica Polytechnica 2008.<br/>},

To face the impact of the global energy crisis, one of the options is to use biofuels including biodiesel. To this end, this program is to perform study on biodiesel microturbine testing and analysis. A 150kW microturbine generator set with twin rotating disk regenerators was used. Designed as a vehicular microturbine engine, the twin rotating ceramic disk regenerators dramatically improve fuel consumption by transferring heat energy from the exhaust gas stream to compressor discharge. This paper involved testing of the microturbine generator set at different load conditions using 10%-30% biodiesel fuel. A software program was used to predict the performance of the microturbine generator set at different operating conditions in order to compare with the test results. Both biodiesel and petrodiesel fuels are used on the microturbine generator system in this study and the results will be compared. Copyright &copy; 2007 by ASME.},

We present and evaluate the design of the Logical Decision Making Server (LDMS), a rule-based automated decision making component used in the Single Location Surveillance Point (SLSP) system. To validate the robustness of the LDMS design for operation in the SLSP environment, we design and conduct a stress test experiment in which large load of TCP/IP input messages is sent instantaneously to the LDMS prototype implementation using the Nethawk EAST software. The stress test results are compared to measurements obtained during a real-life scenario. The LDMS is observed to withstand a significant amount of load without crashing, and its performance is can be considered sufficient for the SLSP system needs. A detailed analysis of results however shows an increase in the latency resulting from an extreme temporal load. We identify potential areas in the design to be improved if demands for higher response rates arise. The research is based on the construction of the related publications and technologies, and the results are established from the testing and validation of the implemented LDMS within the SLSP system. &copy; 2009 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {The pump is one of the key equipments for the safety production of coal mine. It bears the important task to discharge all the underground water. However, the performance efficiency of the water pump will be declined, in the long run. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety production, users should check and test the pump performance regularly, to test if every target pump has live up to the "Coal Mine Safety Regulations". The ultimate goal in finding the fault in time, eliminating hidden dangers, reducing accidents, and saving maintenance costs can be attained. Virtual instrument is the production of modern computer and instrument technology combined in-depth, and is an important technology of computer-assisted testing area. The core idea is "software replacing hardware". The paper introduces the virtual instrument technology into the field of pump performance testing, and designs the mine pump comprehensive performance testing system based on Labview. The system takes software development environment-LabVIEW as platform and based on personal computer, and realizes the function that pump's import and export of water pressure, flow, speed, power, and other signals measured in real-time and dynamic displayed. It uses the polynomial fitting module of LabVIEW to fit the performance curve, and shows the performance curve by the waveform display. At the same time, it uses the Web Publishing Tool of LabVIEW to release the testing interface to the internet, and realizes its network communication function.

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied previously to UML-driven stress test requirements generation with the aim of increasing chances of discovering faults relating to network traffic in distributed real-time systems. However, since evolutionary algorithms are heuristic, their performance can vary across multiple executions, which may affect robustness and scalability. To address this, we present the design and technical detail of a UML-driven, GA-based stress test requirements generation tool, together with its empirical analysis. The main goal is to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness and also to validate the design choices of the GA used in the tool. Findings of the empirical evaluation reveal that the tool is robust and reasonably scalable when it is executed on large-scale experimental design models. The study also reveals the main bottlenecks and limitations of the tools, e.g., there is a performance bottleneck when the system under test has a large number of sequence diagrams which could be triggered independently from each other. In addition, issues specific to stress testing, e.g., the impact of variations in task arrival pattern types, reveal that the tool generally generates effective test requirements, although the features of those test requirements might be different in different runs (e.g., different stress times from the test start time might be chosen). While the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate software test cases has been widely reported, the extent, depth, and detail of the empirical findings presented in this paper are novel and suggest that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in generating stress test requirements. It is hoped that the findings of this empirical study will help other SBSE researchers with the empirical evaluation of their own techniques and tools. &copy; 2010 IEEE.<br/>},

Hence, the safety assurance of the vital software running on the train control system is very critical task and yet, not many works have been done. While much efforts have been reported to improve electronic hardware's safety, not so much systematic approaches to evaluate software's safety. In this paper, we suggested an automated tool for performance testing in train control system, and presented its result of implementation. The testing items in the implemented tool had referred to the international standards in relation to the software for train control system, such as IEC 61508 and IEC 62279. In these international standards, 'performance testing' for train control system S/W has to be recommended highly. &copy;ICROS.<br/>},

abstract = {The growth of software applications in size and complexity is being followed by a number of specific nonfunctional requirements such as portability, interoperability, and availability on various platforms. Most often, these have been addressed by middleware or programming environment. In addition, easy customizability, adaptability, and sharing of components facilitates the development cycle. These should be understood and applied in a broader sense, i.e. to byproducts created during the development process such as programs for functional and performance testing. Much time is spent on developing test programs but their quality and quality of thus obtained results varies largely if the process is not standardized and automated. In this paper we present our experience with performance testing of a large scale suite of gateways that are used for the seamless integration of heterogeneous communication networks. We analyze the commercial and public domain tools for load generation and motivate our decision to define an in-house framework and build a distributed tool for performance, testing that is also not restricted by licensing issues and is readily available to everyone involved. Our tool is built on Visper, the object-oriented distributed programming middleware. The suitability and adaptability of the Visper model for rapid application development and the quality of produced result have proven our decision correct.},

abstract = {NAVSYS has modified the design of its Software GPS Receiver to optimize performance for various space-based scenarios. These include capabilities to track GPS satellites from missions that are at altitudes higher than the GPS constellation. The approach is based on Digital Beam Steering, which also presents significant advantages for multipath mitigation, which will improve kinematic carrier phase tracking and GPS interferometric attitude determination for orbital applications. In addition, the composite signal formed from the beam steering algorithms lends itself to antenna placement around the spacecraft body, which will result in continuous visibility, even for spinning satellites. Inertial aiding with the SGR has also been adapted for space applications including high dynamic scenarios in which it is difficult to track GPS. In order to test the modifications required for the Space-Software GPS Receiver (SSGR), the NAVSYS simulation tools suite has been augmented to account for orbital scenarios. This involved adding an interface to the GPS Toolbox product to accept orbital trajectories generated with Satellite Tool Kit. The Toolbox in turn drives the hardware simulations with the Advanced GPS Hybrid Simulator.},

These models are not cycle-accurate, so their results can have significant errors, leading to performance surprises after the hardware is built. Some performance tests can run directly on the logic simulators, to get more accurate results, but those simulators cannot run large interactive workloads with I/O and much operating system code. So the accurate performance estimates from logic simulators are only available for application code, and are not adequate for the evaluation of powerful server systems that are primarily intended to run large interactive workloads. We discuss a software tool system, the "Reverse Tracer", that generates executable performance tests from an instruction trace of the workload. The generated performance tests retain the essential performance characteristics of multi-user I/O-intensive workloads without doing any real I/O, so they can run in logic simulation to measure performance accurately before the hardware is built. &copy; 2002 IEEE.},

The analytical accuracy of the this system, documented during the recent test exercise, represents a significant improvement in performance relative to that previously achieved, and can be attributed with certainty to the recent implementation of a shrouded nozzle sampling system. By reducing deposition losses of particulate matter in the extracted stack gas stream to acceptable levels, presentation of a more representative sample stream to the elemental analyzer has been accomplished.
