abstract = {Spinal cord lesions can cause a series of severe complications, which can even lead to paralysis with high mortality. However, the traditional diagnosis of spinal cord lesion relies on complicated imaging modalities and other invasive and dangerous methods. Here, we have designed a small monitor based on NIRS technology for noninvasive monitoring for spinal cord lesions. The development of the instrument system includes the design of hardware circuits and the program of software. In terms of hardware, OPT101<sup>1</sup>is selected as the light detector, and the appropriate probe distribution structure is selected according to the simulation result of Monte Carlo Simulation. At the same time, the powerful controller is selected as our system's central processing chip for the circuit design, and the data is transmitted by serial port to the host computer for post processing. Finally, we verify the stability and feasibility of the instrument system. It is found that the spinal signal could be obviously detected in the system, which indicates that our monitor based on NIRS technology has the potential to monitor the spinal lesion.<br/> &copy; 2018 SPIE.},

abstract = {Context: The performance assessment of complex software systems is not a trivial task since it depends on the design, code, and execution environment. All these factors may affect the system quality and generate negative consequences, such as delays and system failures. The identification of bad practices leading to performance flaws is of key relevance to avoid expensive rework in redesign, reimplementation, and redeployment. Objective: The goal of this manuscript is to provide a systematic process, based on load testing and profiling data, to identify performance issues with runtime data. These performance issues represent an important source of knowledge as they are used to trigger the software refactoring process. Software characteristics and performance measurements are matched with well-known performance antipatterns to document common performance issues and their solutions. Method: We execute load testing based on the characteristics of collected operational profile, thus to produce representative workloads. Performance data from the system under test is collected using a profiler tool to create profiler snapshots and get performance hotspot reports. From such data, performance issues are identified and matched with the specification of antipatterns. Software refactorings are then applied to solve these performance antipatterns. Results: The approach has been applied to a real-world industrial case study and to a representative laboratory study. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool-supported approach that is able to automatically detect two performance antipatterns by exploiting the knowledge of domain experts. In addition, the software refactoring process achieves a significant performance gain at the operational stage in both case studies. Conclusion: Performance antipatterns can be used to effectively support the identification of performance issues from load testing and profiling data. The detection process triggers an antipattern-based software refactoring that in our two case studies results in a substantial performance improvement.<br/> &copy; 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {High strain drop weight dynamic load testing is an effective tool when evaluating the construction quality and axial capacity of offshore drilled deep foundations. This is a result of the complexity and cost of the alternative conventional static load tests. Drop weight systems can be designed for project specific needs, providing sufficient energy to mobilize the required resistance while permitting ease in transporting the device. Test shafts/piles can be instrumented and analyzed using the same dynamic testing techniques used for driven pile foundations. A case study is presented where drop weight dynamic load tests were utilized for offshore drilled shaft foundations. The project includes the design, construction, and quality control for a cement unloading pier at the Tema port in Ghana, Africa. The foundations are unique, consisting of 0.8m outer diameter steel pipes embedded in 1.0m rock-socketed drilled shafts. Three dynamic load tests to failure and six load verification tests were performed offshore. The load verification tests were carried out due to construction difficulties and/or complex subsurface conditions. The piles' integrity and mobilized resistances were assessed using the signal matching analysis software CAPWAP. The underlying assumptions in the one-dimensional wave equation formulation on which CAPWAP is based are violated in these complex cases. Finite element analyses were therefore performed using the PLAXIS 2D software in order to examine the validity of the one-dimensional wave equation application under such conditions. This paper briefly describes the project, the associated difficulties, the unique foundations, example load tests and their analyses, as well as some initial processing in examining the validity of the one-dimensional wave equation analyses under the tested conditions. &copy; ASCE.},

abstract = {This work presents the performance testing of an arduino-controlled hybrid solar-electric cabinet dryer under no-load condition. The integral hybrid system mainly consists of solar and electric heat components which are connected to a programmable circuit board (micro-controller) with a piece of software (integrated development environment, IDE) known as arduino micro-processor which controls and automates the overall operation of the dryer system through its relay and receives signals from transducer sensors (a capacitive humidity and thermistor sensors) placed at different locations on the dryer. Through the use of a 4 X 4 matrix keypad, preset chamber temperature threshold and chamber air flow rates were inputted; relative humidities of the different locations, tray and chamber temperatures and energy consumption from both solar and electric energy sources were measured, recorded, displayed on the liquid crystal display (LCD) and transferred to a microcomputer via a universal serial board (USB) cord. With the arduino platform, the quantity of moisture loss per given time and energy required for drying as well as other basic drying parameters can be effectively measured with minimum human supervision, thus making the entire operation automated and efficient. No-load tests were conducted to evaluate the thermal profile of the dryer, which involved running the dryer at five different air velocities (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s) in order to determine the required time to reach the preset optimum drying temperatures of 50, 55, 60, 65, 70oC. Results obtained show that an average minimum drying chamber heat-up times of 9.8 and 6.2 minutes were required by the electrical and hybrid heat sources at a temperature and air velocity of 70oC and 2 m/s respectively. Ambient air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were observed to have significant influence on the dryer heat-up time and tray temperatures. Drying time had significant effect on the energy consumption of the dryer mainly due to hourly solar heat. The hybrid and electric heat sources developed a maximum chamber temperature of about 92.5 and 84oC respectively after 210 minutes. Peak energy of 1946 and 1485kW-hr were developed by the hybrid and electric heat units respectively and 784kW/m<sup>2</sup>was developed by the solar collector. The solar component contributed a maximum drying chamber temperature of 30 to 31.7oC which is about 50 to 55% of the required drying chamber temperature. Energy regression equation models were developed in terms of time for each heat source as well as the hybrid with an average R<sup>2</sup>-value of 0.99. The general performance of the dryer was attributed to the heat contribution of the solar collector and that of the electric heater as well as its negligible thermal losses. Good prospects for future applications as well as recommendations were stated.<br/>},

abstract = {Open-hole in-situ stress measurements have gained increasing significance in recent years, from front end loading of major hydraulic fracturing campaigns, as well as cap-rock integrity assurance and management of Out Of Zone Injection (OOZI) for pressure maintenance or secondary recovery purposes. The latter has become particularly important in recent years, with an increasing scrutiny of injection operations and their containment assurance. In response to this requirement, wireline deployed dual-packer micro-fracturing has been the most commonplace approach taken to obtain such data. However, such Wire-line Formation Tester (WFT) measurements have their own technical limitations, particularly with respect to the wellbore deviation, hole-size and pressure differential limits that can be applied. Just such a scenario was faced where a number of planned development wells were being drilled and were radiating from a suite of fixed drill centres, resulting in extensive and large sail angle sections in the zones within and across the cap-rock of interest. The use of conventional WFT micro-fracturing operations was considered to be too challenging under this scenario; due to the wellbore inclinations, the pressure limits, the probability of failure, the timings, the costs and the operational complexity in such a difficult environment. The proposed solution was to resurrect a technique that had been used on just very few occasions some 30 years ago, prior to the availability of the WFT approach, which was the use of drill-string deployed dualpacker tools for stress measurements. Due to the lack of recent industry experience with this type of application, the tool and equipment selection, the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) design and operational considerations were of paramount importance and required considerable planning. This paper describes the technology selection, planning, contingency options, risk mitigation, operational aspects and the outcome of the first operation from the initial concept to its final execution. It includes how the tools were successfully selected, tested and deployed, the packers inflated and set, and injection tests made within the target formation; with a number of lessons learned on the tool behaviour, the injection and the test approaches taken. The downhole data was efficiently retrieved and a suite of recommendations have resulted from the operations in general. Accurate in-situ stress measurements have been successfully made in a cap-rock formation from an open-hole section of a well at high-angle, using a pipe-deployed dual-packer approach. While the often used WFT micro-fracturing technique can address the majority of scenarios, situations can arise where a pipe-deployed approach offers the only effective and economic means of obtaining such data. The data that can be obtained is helpful for designing wells and defining the operational envelope for increasing the reliability and efficiency of injector wells to achieve field development objectives.<br/> Copyright 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract = {The extraordinary locomotory abilities of geckos are attributed to striking adhesive setae segmented into scansors or pads on the undersides of the toes or legs, have been well-known for many centuries due to van der waals force. The outstanding climbing performances of the animal inspired the engineers and researchers for the design of artificial systems, such as adhesive materials, which in turn enabled the construction of climbing robots that are capable of climbing smooth walls and ceiling. The robot based on van der waals force has a wide prospect for execution space task application. Legged climbing robot involves the controlled application of forces during the leg-substrate contact and release, in order to propel the body forwards. The achievement of strong attachment and easy removal of the adhesive is the critical issues, when we apply the adhesive to the robot's footpad. Here, by using a custom-built force platform, adhesion performance of the bio-inspired adhesive which directly apply to the footpad were investigated. The effect of footpad stiffness, contact area and trajectory on adhesion force and real contact area is investigated. Results show that normal force and shear force increased as stiffness increase up to 68.9 N/m. After that, normal force and shear force decrease as stiffness increase. Both normal force and shear force increase as real contact area increase, but not increase linearly. Additionally, different attaching trajectories are applied to explore the adhesion characteristic of the footpad. The result indicates that for the robot, the footpad of this kind does not need much load control: the pad just needs to contact the surface, in order to produce substantial adhesion force and meet the requirement of the attaching phase. This characteristic of footpad is extremely beneficial for applying it at zero gravity, when the robot cannot rely on gravity to load the adhesive pad. Furthermore, normal force and shear of the footpad during one cycle are tested. The force is compared with the frictional-adhesion model. Stable adhesion region under different conditions can be obtained by adjust peeling angle and effective real contact area. Finally, optimized footpad stiffness, area and trajectory are selected and stable adhesion region is analyzed. By using gravity compensation method to simulate micro-gravity environment and designing attachment and detachment trajectory, the robot can climb stably under zero gravity environment up to 1 cm/s. This paper presents adhesion performance test and trajectory optimization of gecko-inspired footpad under simulated micro-gravity environment. The experimental tests demonstrated that the robot can climb under mimic zero gravity at the velocity of up to 1 cm/s. The major contribution of this work is the application of the biological principle of footpad to the legged robot, and the demonstration of the feasibility and reliability of this design. To the best of our knowledge, the legged robot, climbing under nearly zero gravity, is demonstrated here for the first time. We also explore the effect of the stiffness, contact area and attaching trajectory on the reliability of the robot locomotion. This research could be a basis for the space application of micro-adhesion robot. &copy; 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract = {In the spring of 2012, as part of a &lsquo;hub and spoke&rsquo; model of research to address the human performance concerns related to current as well as new and advanced control room designs and operations, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) sponsored a project to procure a low cost simulator to empirically measure and study human performance aspects of control room operations. Using this simulator, the Human Factors and Reliability Branch (HFRB) in the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) began a program of research known as the NRC Human Performance Test Facility (HPTF) to collect empirical human performance data with the purpose of measuring and ultimately better understanding the various cognitive and physical elements that support safe control room operation. To accomplish this, HFRB first procured two 3-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor simulators with the capability to run a full range of power operation scenarios. HFRB staff work as co-investigators along with a team of researchers at the University of Central Florida (UCF) to design and carry-out a series of experiments aimed at measuring and understanding the human performance aspects of common control room tasks through the use of a variety of physiological and self-report metrics. The intent was to design experiments that balanced domain realism and laboratory control sufficiently to collect systematic, yet meaningful human performance data related to execution of common main control room (MCR) tasks. Investigators identified and defined three types of tasks that are examined in the present project: Checking, Detection, and Response Implementation. Task type presentation was partially counterbalanced to maintain ecologic validity with experimental control. A variety of subjective and physiological measures were used to understand performance of those tasks in terms ofworkload. The simulator used to collect these data was a digital representation of a generic analog NPP MCR interface. The data resulting from this experimentation enhances the current information gathering process, allowing for more robust technical bases to support regulatory guidance development and decision making. The present paper describes the approach behind this research effort. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

Most screens had electro-mechanical systems that were expensive, complex and caused concern for possible malfunctions in unstaffed remote locations. Consequently, a novel sewerage overflow device 'Comb Separator' was conceived, developed and tested. Optimum criteria were achieved for the device using trial and error method; robustness of the experimental set-up was tested to reproduce consistent results.

It will be made up of approximately 100 telescopes of at least three different sizes, from 4 to 23 meters in diameter. The NectarCAM is a Cherenkov camera proposed for the Mid- Size Telescopes of CTA. Its characteristics make it one of the most challenging camera projects for a high speed data acquisition (DAQ) system in CTA has due to its average output rate of up to 40-Gbps on 265 Ethernet 1000baseT links, bundled to 4-10Gbps on four optical links and reduced to 10 Gbps after event-building. This paper presents results on characterisation and validation procedures carried out on several Ethernet switches, which have been considered as hardware for the camera-internal data traffic of NectarCAM. Two complementary types of data generators, one highly synchronous with up to 64 1-Gbps channels based on an FPGA core, the other with up to 320 1-Gbps channels working on 64 Scientific Linux boards, have been built and used to stimulate the DAQ system with six Ethernet switches and a standard Linux PC for IP packet reception.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of agricultural science and technology, various types of environmental testing equipments and production facilities consume a lot of energy in greenhouse. Therefore, it is important to design a high-efficiency greenhouse power supply device. At the same time, the energy crisis in the 21st century and the air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels become serious. It can not wait to solve the environmental pollution. Therefore, increasing the development and utilization of solar energy is imminent. Solar energy is a kind of clean and renewable energy, and the study of solar energy development and utilization has become a hot issue nowadays, but in general, its efficiency is low. In order to solve the problem of large fossil energy consumption in the greenhouse and the current inefficient use of solar energy, compound parabolic concentrator-photovoltaic/thermoelectric hybrid power generation system (CPC-PV/TE) based on the characteristics of greenhouse in Northeast China is proposed in the present paper. A system contains CPC, PV/TE hybrid system and flat heat pipe. CPC converges light to the surface of photovoltaic cells. It enhances light irradiation intensity. Photovoltaic cells use the photovoltaic effect principle to generate electricity. Attached to photovoltaic cells, thermoelectric power generator modules convert the excess heat generated by photovoltaic cells power generation to electricity power simultaneously. Flat heat pipe is used as heat transfer element, and then a certain amount of water is used to effectively transfer the rest of the heat. In order to express the performance of CPC-PV/TE hybrid power generation system accurately, a comprehensive energy transfer model has been established, and the efficiency of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system and PV or TE module alone under different levels of irradiation and various water flows has been discussed. The results show that the faster the cooling water flows, the higher the generated power by CPC-PV/TE hybrid system is, but there is a limit. The efficiency of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system is greater than the PV or TE module alone. Moreover, experimental test system has been built, and a series of experimental researches have been done on CPC-PV/TE hybrid system with water-cooled flat heat pipe in greenhouse of Northeast Agricultural University. As a result, in transient experimental research, photovoltaic power generation accounts for a large proportion, so variation tendency of generated power by CPC-PV/TE system is similar to photovoltaic. For thermoelectric power generation modules join in the CPC-PV/TE hybrid system, the generated power and the efficiency of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system increase; it gains the maximum power output of 125.98 W, and the efficiency gets to 20.06%. A cascade utilization of solar energy is achieved, and then its utilization is improved. From April 7, 2015 to April 11, 2015, the daily performance of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system has been evaluated, and the generated power of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system varies from 2.35 to 3.24 MJ. The efficiency of CPC-PV/TE hybrid system in these days is more than 18.57%, and the highest value is 19.15%. CPC-PV/TE hybrid system is superior to existing PV/TE system. More importantly, CPC-PV/TE hybrid system basically meets the power requirements of the greenhouse environment monitoring systems and lighting equipments. It has a greater advantage in the field of solar energy comprehensive utilization. &copy;, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

abstract = {Tasks in real-time embedded systems (RTES) are often subject to hard deadlines that constrain how quickly the system must react to external inputs. These inputs and their timing vary in a large domain depending on the environment state and can never be fully predicted prior to system execution. Therefore, approaches for stress testing must be developed to uncover possible deadline misses of tasks for different input arrival times. In this article, we describe stress-test case generation as a search problem over the space of task arrival times. Specifically, we search for worst-case scenarios maximizing deadline misses, where each scenario characterizes a test case. In order to scale our search to large industrial-size problems, we combine two state-of-the-art search strategies, namely, genetic algorithms (GA) and constraint programming (CP). Our experimental results show that, in comparison with GA and CP in isolation, GA+CP achieves nearly the same effectiveness as CP and the same efficiency and solution diversity as GA, thus combining the advantages of the two strategies. In light of these results, we conclude that a combined GA+CP approach to stress testing is more likely to scale to large and complex systems. 2015 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

However, in order for electric power utility companies to adopt IEC 61850 standard-based devices with confidence, it is necessary to carry out performance tests and evaluations to allay their fears. This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of IEC 61850 standard-based devices with respect to their speed, security, and dependability of operation. The study was implemented using multi-vendor IEDs configured for a Permissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) communication scheme with conventional proprietary protocols and the IEC 61850 Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messages based on hardware-in-the-loop simulations with the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). RSCAD software was used in the modelling of a typical power system network protected by two multi-vendor distance protection IEDs using a lab-scale testbed designed and implemented for the investigations relating to this paper. Real-time simulations for various fault locations and fault resistances were carried out. The results obtained demonstrated the dependability and security of the operation of the IEC 61850-based POTT communication scheme with faster operating times compared with the conventional POTT communication scheme based on vendor-specific proprietary protocols. This paper could serve as a reference to electric power utility companies as they adopt IEC 61850 standard-based devices in their networks. &copy; 2015 CPUT.},

However, the silicon material of CMOS image sensors has the ionizing dose effect in the high-energy rays, and then the indicators of image sensors, such as signal noise ratio (SNR), non-uniformity (NU) and bad point (BP) are degraded because of the radiation. The radiation environment of test experiments was generated by the<sup>60</sup>Co &gamma;-rays source. The camera module based on image sensor CMV2000 from CMOSIS Inc. was chosen as the research object. The ray dose used for the experiments was with a dose rate of 20krad/h. In the test experiences, the output signals of the pixels of image sensor were measured on the different total dose. The results of data analysis showed that with the accumulation of irradiation dose, SNR of image sensors decreased, NU of sensors was enhanced, and the number of BP increased. The indicators correction of image sensors was necessary, as it was the main factors to image quality. The image processing arithmetic was adopt to the data from the experiences in the work, which combined local threshold method with NU correction based on non-local means (NLM) method. The results from image processing showed that image correction can effectively inhibit the BP, improve the SNR, and reduce the NU. &copy; 2016 SPIE.},

abstract = {Under lightning environment, architecture safety gets more and more attention while vehicle equipment falls into neglect. In lightning protection, earth device plays an important role. But conventional earth electrode of vehicle equipment can&rsquo;t meet the needs of protection. In this paper, a new type of portable horizontal grid earth electrode has been designed for mobile equipment. With the impulse ground measurement system, the performance of horizontal earth electrodes are tested and analyzed. The responses to double exponential pulse current of four earth electrodes in different arrangements have been tested on cement floor, respectively. After filtering and calculating, the curves of Transient Grounding Resistance (TGR) in time domain can be gotten. The results show that the same numbers of electrodes have different stable value of TGR in different arrangements, and the lowest value is in a line arrangement. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {In order to design heat pipe tools with rational structure, first, a performance test system of heat pipe was developed to simulate the working conditions of heat pipe in the lathe tool. Next, the operation parameters of the heat pipe were optimized by means of orthogonal test. Then, based on the optimization results, three heat pipe tools with different installation forms, including the embedding, the lateral compression and the slot embedding, were designed and fabricated. Finally, an experiment in dry turning of 45# steel was carried out to quantitatively evaluate the heat dissipation performance of the tools. The results of heat dissipation performance test demonstrate that, when the heating length of the evaporator section is 18 mm, the cooling length of the condenser section is 20 mm, the temperature of recycling water is 75&deg;C and the bending angle of the heat pipe is 5&deg;, both the round and the flat heat pipes are of the optimum heat transfer performance. In addition, the calorimetric experiment in cutting process show that the heat pipe tool with embedding form possesses the highest heat transfer efficiency, while that with lateral compression form possesses the lowest one.<br/>},

abstract = {Fine manipulation is the key step during the Oolong tea process. The aroma and taste of Oolong tea were brought out from the step which is repeatedly and alternately rocking and airing. The traditional fine manipulation of Oolong tea is "rocking and airing in different place" with air-conditioning in south Fujian. The process by which tea leaves are put into a mechanical cylinder by turns is called the rocking technique. Then tea leaves are laid into a sieve in an air-conditioned room in what is called an airing technique. The traditional fine manipulation wastes much labor consumption and the3 working posture was difficult to adapt with the spreading and moving of leaves by workers due to the need to carry out the rocking and airing techniques in different place. A larger area and more energy were wasted in the air-conditioning room, and conditions are difficult even. In order to solve those problems, new vibrating fine manipulation (VFM) equipment was developed. The equipment has the combined capability of rocking, airing and environment control techniques. It consisted of the power system, vibrating device, and environment control system. The power system consisted of the power source and eccentric, which could provide driving force to vibrating tea leaves. The vibrating device was composed of a vibrating basket, including a vibrated grid and the static cabinet. Moreover, it could provide spaces for vibrating and airing. The environment regulation system consisted of temperature and humidity adjusted devices including new wind installation and air pipelines, which could provide suitable environmental conditions for the fine manipulation process. The environment regulating performance test of the equipment (ZQ) was investigated with the Tieguanyin variety in spring and summer. The study used the traditional fine manipulation technique with air-conditioning (CK) as a check in south Fujian. ZQ<inf>1</inf>-Vibrating and airing all selected air conveying high gear. ZQ<inf>2</inf>-Vibrating selected air conveying high gear, and airing at low. ZQ<inf>3</inf>-Vibrating and airing all selected air conveying low gear. The results showed that it could effectively control the environment parameters. The velocity of the airflow was controlled at 0.46-0.64 m/s between the tea layers, according to breeze requirements (0.5 m/s). Meanwhile the air temperature was regulated between 22&deg;C and 24&deg;C. It was significantly lower than the temperature of the natural fine manipulation environment in spring (P&lt;0.05). Moreover air relative humidity was regulated between 60% and 80%. It was significantly lower than the humidity of the natural fine manipulation environment in spring (P&lt;0.05). CO<inf>2</inf> volume fraction was controlled between 300 and 400 &mu;l/L. It was significantly lower than the air-conditioning fine manipulation environment in summer (P&lt;0.01). The results showed that the equipment takes advantages of working posture comfort, labor and energy saving. The quality of vibrating fine manipulation raw tea was significantly better than the traditional tea (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, the working posture discomfort of six is only 1/3 in contrast with the traditional method. Then labor and energy consumption with the new equipment is only 1/2 in contrast with the traditional method. The results could provide the technical basis for continuous, clean, standardized processing of Oolong tea.},

The superposition of two induced stresses, mechanical and hydraulic, causes the tensile failure to initiate towards the end of the drilled hole as the hydraulic pressure is increased. The 9-mm-diameter hole is drilled from the center of the sealing compression pad to a depth of up to 15 cm. A fracture initiating some distance from the wellbore will be located part way through the near-wellbore perturbed stress field and will propagate away from the wellbore to the far field in the direction of reduced minimum stress. Reservoir simulation shows that the leakage rate of injected fluid around the compression pad is insignificant. The first jobs using this technique are described, including procedures for passive tool orientation so that the drilled hole is aligned with the maximum horizontal stress. Information revealed about breakdown pressures in tight dolomite explained why drilling-induced fractures were affecting resistivity logs and well test interpretation. The current procedure for stress testing is the pumping of drilling mud between inflated packers. The new technique described here solves two problems associated with the inflated packer method. The pumped fluid volumes are much smaller, so clean fracture fluid from a sample chamber can be used instead of mud. And the system compressibility is reduced, so the pressure transients are more responsive to the formation. The ability to induce a fracture in the formation with a pad tool using dedicated fluid with a low dead volume creates a new way of connecting to the reservoir, an alternative to connecting via the borehole wall surface. This large, undamaged contact area due to the induced fracture beyond the drilling-damaged zone will facilitate sampling low-permeability formations or high-viscosity oils.

abstract = {Spatial data infrastructure (SDI) facilitates the collection, maintenance, dissemination and use of spatial information. To stimulate SDI development effectively and efficiently, it is key to assess the progress and benefits of the SDI. SDI is difficult to assess because of its complex, dynamic, multi-faceted and constantly evolving nature. Several SDI assessment methods exist. However, these are still in an infancy stage and none of these appear to meet the requirements of practitioners. As a result, SDI decision makers are still without any guidance on the success of their SDI. In this paper we propose a new method for SDI assessment: The STIG, a Stress-test for Infrastructures of Geographical information. The development and application of the Stress-test methodology will provide new valuable information for decision-makers about the aspects of SDIs that need to be improved in order to take full advantage of the potential benefit of the SDIs, especially in the instance of disaster management. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing has become increasingly common. Verifying that applications deployed in the cloud meet their performance requirements is not simple. There are three different techniques for performance evaluation: analytical modeling, simulation, and measurement. While analytical modeling and simulation are good techniques for getting an early performance estimation, they rely on an abstract representation of the system and leave out details related for instance to the system configuration. Such details are problematic to model or simulate, however they can be the source of the bottlenecks in the deployed system. In this paper, we present a model-based performance testing tool that measures the performance on web applications and services using the measurement technique. The tool uses models to generate workload which is then applied to the system in realtime and it measures different performance indicators. The models are defined using probabilistic timed automata and they describe how different user types interact with the system. We describe how load is generated from the models and the features of the tool. The utility of the tool is demonstrated by applying to a WebDav case study.

abstract = {Load testing method is a significant tool in the assessment of bridge safety. One type of load tests is diagnostic load testing, the aim of which is to establish a comparison between real bridge behaviour and analytical calculation. It can be used either as acceptance test of the structures or as an estimation tool for the load carrying capacity of the already existing structures that have been in service for some time. This article presents diagnostic load tests and three examples of their application to various bridge structures and emphasises their diagnostic potential for assessment. In the majority of cases of diagnostic load tests presented in the literature, the experimental results (deflections, strains, etc) are very close or lower than the predicted ones and for this reason, such tests are expected to validate the existing structure. However, in the cases presented here, it is shown how the experimental results differ considerably from the expected ones. Since the theoretical and the experimental results of all three examples did not match, it was highly recommended to keep the matter under close investigation. A deep insight into the bridges showed serviceability and safety concerns and in some cases a repair/strengthening was necessary. &copy; 2013 &copy; 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.<br/>},

abstract = {Workload generation is essential to systematically evaluate performance properties of application systems under controlled conditions, e.g., in load tests or benchmarks. The definition of workload specifications that represent the real workload as accurately as possible is one of the biggest challenges in this area. This paper presents our approach for the modeling and automatic extraction of probabilistic workload specifications for load testing session-based application systems. The approach, called Wessbas, comprises (i.) a domain-specific language (DSL) enabling layered modeling of workload specifications as well as support for (ii.) automatically extracting instances of the DSL from recorded sessions logs and (iii.) transforming instances of the DSL to workload specifications of existing load testing tools. During the extraction process, different groups of customers with similar navigational patterns are identified using clustering techniques. We developed corresponding tool support including a transformation to probabilistic test scripts for the Apache JMeter load testing tool. The evaluation of the proposed approach using the industry standard benchmark SPECjEnterprise2010 demonstrates its applicability and the representativeness of the extracted workloads. &copy; Copyright 2015 ICST.},

abstract = {Sudden variations in current (large di/dt) can lead to significant power supply voltage droops and timing errors in modern microprocessors. Several papers discuss the complexity involved with developing test programs, also known as stress marks, to stress the system. Authors of these papers produced tools and methodologies to generate stress marks automatically using techniques such as integer linear programming or genetic algorithms. However, nearly all of the previous work took place in the context of single-core systems, and results were collected and analyzed using cycle-level simulators. In this paper, we measure and analyze di/dt issues on state-of-the-art multi-core x86 systems using real hardware rather than simulators. We build on an existing single-core stress mark generation tool to develop an Automated DI/dT stress mark generation framework, referred to as AUDIT, to generate di/dt stress marks quickly and effectively for multicore systems. We showcase AUDIT's capabilities to adjust to micro architectural and architectural changes. We also present a dithering algorithm to address thread alignment issues on multi-core processors. We compare standard benchmarks, existing di/dt stress marks, and AUDIT-generated stress marks executing on multi-threaded, multi-core systems with complex out-of-order pipelines. Finally, we show how stress analysis using simulators may lead to flawed insights about di/dt issues. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Load testing of IT applications faces the challenge of providing high quality test results that would represent the performance in production like scenarios, without incurring high cost of commercial load testing tools. It would help IT projects to be able to test with a small number of users and extrapolate to scenarios with much larger number of users. Such an extrapolation strategy when applied to mixture of application workloads running on a shared server environment must take into consideration application characteristics (CPU/IO intensive, memory bound) as well the server capabilities. The goal is to predict the performance of mixture workload, the maximum throughput offered by the application mix and the maximum number of users supported by the system before the throughput starts degrading. In this paper, we propose an extrapolation strategy that analyses a system workload mix based on its service demand on various resources and extrapolates its performance using simple empirical modeling techniques. Moreover, its ability to extrapolate throughput of an application mixture even if there is a change in the mixture, can help in capacity planning of the system. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {[Context] A variety of testing tools have been developed to support and automate software performance testing activities. These tools may use different techniques, such as Model-Based Testing (MBT) or Capture and Replay (CR). [Goal] For software companies, it is important to evaluate such tools w.r.t. the effort required for creating test artifacts using them; despite its importance, there are few empirical studies comparing performance testing tools, specially tools developed with different approaches. [Method]We are conducting experimental studies to provide evidence about the required effort to use CR-based tools and MBT tools. In this paper, we present our first results, evaluating the effort (time spent) when using LoadRunner and Visual Studio CRbased tools, and the PLeTsPerf MBT tool to create performance test scripts and scenarios to test Web applications, in the context of a collaboration project between Software Engineering Research Center at PUCRS and a technological laboratory of a global IT company. [Results] Our results indicate that, for simple testing tasks, the effort of using a CR-based tool was lower than using an MBT tool, but as the testing complexity increases tasks, the advantage of using MBT grows significantly.

The reality is that the workload models in performance testing often missed their real-world scenario targets due to missing "significant non critical" web usages or lack of accurate workload model validation. The accuracy of workload model is directly reflected back into the understanding of web app usage pattern in production. Without an accurate workload model, not only performance test results could be incorrect, but also many following tasks, performance bottleneck recreating, server performance tuning, capacity planning, and application framework validation could be at wrong targets. I will walk you through a practical way of building accurate workload model that will be matching to the targeted prod workload much closer comparing to the workload model created in current performance testing practice.

The importance of testing is emphasized in TDD and the automated test framework is supported for efficient software development with unit tests. In this paper, we propose the methods of performance testing based on test-driven development with regard to non-functional factors as well as functionality of software during the software development process by advancing performance testing to the development stage and introduce a testing tool that assists performance testing on software development phase. It provides automation of test case generation and test execution at unit test level. It will eventually improve the development productivity as well as the reliability and quality of mobile applications by reducing the time and cost to execute tests in the process of the entire mobile applications development and helping to detect faults.

Software agents are characterized by context awareness, autonomous decision making and social collaboration capabilities. The paper introduces the design of BDI (Believe-Decision-Intention) agents to facilitate adaptive performance testing of Web Services. The BDI model specifies the necessary test knowledge, test goal and action plan to carry out test and adaptive schedule. Performance testing is defined as a scheduling problem to select the workload and test cases in order to achieve the goal of performance abnormal detection. A two-level control architecture is built. At the TR (Test Runner) level, the BDI agents control the workload of concurrent requests. At the TC (Test Coordinator) level, the BDI agents control the complexity of test cases. Agents communicate and collaborate with each other to share knowledge and test plan. The paper introduces the design of the BDI model, the adaptation rules and the control architecture. Case study is exercised to illustrate the adaptive testing process based on the design of BDI agents. &copy; 2010 IEEE.},

Its serial design and geometrical dimensions give the motion system a large cylindrical motion space and a broad range of dynamic performance capabilities, which go beyond those of a classical Stewart platform. Like any other motion-base simulator the Desdemona motion system is driven by motion filters that transform the various simulation model outputs into safe and optimal motion cues. For the development of these motion filters it is necessary to exactly determine the dynamic performance characteristics of Desdemona and check whether these characteristics meet the specified motion system requirements. This paper describes the test protocol to measure, specify and verify the dynamic performance characteristics of the Desdemona motion system. The performance test protocol builds upon and extends the classical synergistic motion system test approaches, like the AGARD standard, to suite the specific Desdemona motion system capabilities.},

abstract = {Interactive applications with graphical user interfaces are prevalent in today's environment: Everybody with access to any kind of computer constantly uses them. A significant body of prior work has devised approaches for automating the functional testing of such applications. However, no such work exists for automatically testing their performance. Performance testing imposes additional requirements upon GUI test automation tools: the tools have to be able to replay complex interactive sessions, and they have to avoid perturbing the application's performance. We study the feasibility of using five Java GUI capture &amp; replay tools for GUI performance test automation. Besides confirming the severity of the previously known GUI element identification problem, we also identify a related problem, the temporal synchronization problem, which is of increasing importance for GUI applications that use timer-driven activity. We find that most of the tools we study have severe limitations when used for recording and replaying realistic sessions of real-world Java applications, and that all of them suffer from the temporal synchronization problem. However, we find that the most reliable tool, Pounder, causes only limited perturbation, and thus can be used to automate performance testing. Besides the significance of our findings to GUI performance testing, the results are also relevant to capture &amp; replay-based functional GUI test automation approaches. Copyright 2010 ACM.<br/>},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the wireless market and the development of various mobile devices, innovative methods and technologies to produce high-quality mobile applications and reduce time to market have been emerging. Mobile applications are often characterized by an array of limitations such as the short development lifecycle to gain a competitive advantage and difficulties to update once released. Hence, rigorous testing on the applications is required before distribution to the market, including structural white-box, functional black-box, integration and system testing. Although recently performance testing at the system test level has become crucial given its direct connection with the product quality improvement, most such tests are confined to the areas of load, usability, and stress testing. Moreover, the implementation itself is insufficient due to the limitations of the development environment. This paper proposes a method to support performance testing utilizing a database established through benchmark testing in emulator-based test environment at the unit test level. It also presents the tool that supports the proposed method of performance testing and verifies the reliability of performance test results through experiments. &copy; 2009 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {There is an urgent need for a measurement protocol and software analysis for objective testing of the imaging performance of medical ultrasound equipment from a user's point of view. Methods for testing of imaging performance were developed. Simple test objects were used, which have a long life expectancy. First, the elevational focus (slice thickness) of the transducer was estimated and the in-plane transmit focus was positioned at the same depth. Next, the postprocessing look-up-table (LUT) was measured and linearized. The tests performed were echo level dynamic range (dB), contrast resolution (i.e., gamma of display, number of gray levels/dB) and sensitivity, overall system sensitivity, lateral sensitivity profile, dead zone, spatial resolution and geometric conformity of display. The concept of a computational observer was used to define the lesion signal-to-noise ratio, SNR<inf>L</inf> (or Mahalanobis distance), as a measure for contrast sensitivity. All the measurements were made using digitized images and quantified by objective means, i.e., by image analysis. The whole performance measurement protocol, as well as the quantitative measurements, have been implemented in software. An extensive data-base browser was implemented from which analysis of the images can be started and reports generated. These reports contain all the information about the measurements, such as graphs, images and numbers. The approach of calibrating the gamma by using a linearized LUT was validated by processing simultaneously acquired rf data. The contrast resolution and echo level of the rf data had to be compressed by a factor of two and amplified by a gain factor corresponding to 12 dB. This resulted in contrast curves that were practically identical to those obtained from DICOM image data. The effects of changing the transducer center frequency on the spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity were estimated to illustrate the practical usefulness of the developed approach of quality assurance by measuring objective performance characteristics. The developed methods might be considered as a minimum set of objective quality assurance measures. This set might be used to predict clinical performance of medical ultrasound equipment, taking into account the performance at a unique point in space i.e., the coinciding depths of the elevation and in-plane (azimuth) foci. Furthermore, it should be investigated whether the approach might be used to compare objectively various brands of equipment and to evaluate the performance specifications given by the manufacturer. Last but not least, the developed approach can be used to monitor, in a hospital environment, the medical ultrasound equipment during its life cycle.

Using the analytical and simulation method, we analyse a five-stage queuing system with re-entrant to the second stage under various stochastic routing.

A software receiver is utilized to perform the test to analyze on the performances of the tracking loop adopting the second-order and third-order phase-locked loops (PLL), the second-order PLL assisted by the first-order frequency-locked loop (FLL), and the third-order PLL assisted by the second-order FLL.

abstract = {Handheld thermal imaging cameras are an important tool for the first responder community. As their use becomes more prevalent, it will become important for a set of standard test metrics to be available to characterize the performance of these cameras. A major factor in the performance of the imagers is the quality of the image on a display screen. An imager may employ any type of display screen, but the results of this paper will focus on those using liquid crystal displays. First responders, especially firefighters, in the field rely on the performance of this screen to relay vital information during critical situations. Current research on thermal imaging camera performance metrics for first responder applications uses trained observer tests or camera composite output signal measurements. Trained observer tests are subjective and composite output tests do not evaluate the performance of the complete imaging system. It is the goal of this work to develop a non-, destructive, objective method that tests the performance of the entire thermal imaging camera system, from the infrared sensor to the display screen. Application of existing display screen performance metrics to thermal imaging cameras requires additional consideration. Most display screen test metrics require a well defined electronic input, with either full black or white pixel input, often encompassing detailed spatial patterns and resolution. Well characterized thermal inputs must be used to obtain accurate, repeatable, and non-destructive display screen measurements for infrared cameras. For this work, a thermal target is used to correlate the measured camera output with the actual display luminance. A test method was developed to determine display screen luminance. A well characterized CCD camera and digital recording device were used to determine an electro-optical transfer function for thermal imaging cameras. This value directly relates the composite output signal to the luminance of the display screen, providing a realistic characterization of system performance.},

abstract = {Bridge load rating is the primary decision tool that is currently in use to evaluate and predict bridge performance under various loading conditions. Traditional bridge rating calculations involve calculating the load carrying capacity of the structural elements based on design plans, field inspection reports, and engineering judgment. Experience shows that bridge performance is always under-estimated using this simplified approach and in many cases results in placing unnecessary load restrictions on bridges. Bridge diagnostic load testing has been widely recognized as a more reliable and accurate method for bridge rating. However, the time and cost involved in conducting bridge load testing has been a major impediment to employing this valuable tool on a large scale. Bridge owners can typically only afford to perform load testing for major bridges and under critical circumstances. The need for more cost-effective and easy-to-implement methods to perform bridge load testing and rating analysis is well evident. In this paper, the use of an integrated system to conduct bridge load testing, finite element analysis, and rating is demonstrated. The system consists of load testing instrumentation and data acquisition hardware as well as four software components to perform structural analysis and rating calculations. A case study of a prestressed concrete bridge is presented to demonstrate the seamless integration of the load testing and analysis processes.},

Three protocols are available to communicate between Tier 2 and 3: Intelligence Computer Architecture (ICA) with and without data compression, and X Window. We measured the performance of the three protocols in a multi-user environment in which we simulated the workload imposed by typical users. We found that, for Microsoft Office 97 and Lotus Notes applications, the X Window protocol uses approximately twice the network bandwidth of ICA, without compression. We also found that compressed ICA generates roughly one third less network traffic than uncompressed ICA at a cost of 20% of additional processor utilization.},

The author illustrates how to implement this critical signal path in a high-speed test system to get high-precision timing and level measurements, particularly for CMOS devices. The solution suggested to embed a CMOS device in a transmission-line environment is the resistive divider. The operating principle of the resistive divider is to apply a defineable DC load to the DUT. This maintains signal fidelity, as the signal is fed into a parallel terminated system.

Engineering tests are now being conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in order to characterize its overall system performance and component efficiencies within the system environment. A chassis dynamometer is used in order to minimize the ambient effects and large uncertainties present in track testing. Extensive test requirements were defined and procedures were carefully controlled in order to maintain a high degree of credibility. Test results include an energy flow analysis through the major subsystems and incorporate the aerodynamic and rolling losses under cyclic and various steady speed conditions.},
