abstract = {Thermal greases allow a low stress bond at low bond line thicknesses (BLT) at medium thermal conductivities and simple application, all of which make it an alternative to solders, thermal adhesives or pads. It is widely used in power and microprocessor applications, most of which involve large areas to be used for heat transfer. However, for years thermal overload failure of power modules and chips has been a pressing problem due to pump-out of thermal grease as die or module thermal interface material (TIM): Most thermal greases are Bingham fluids and thus no solids, so they can be squeezed out from in between the gap, driven by thermo-mechanical action of the adjacent layers as e.g. DCB substrate or silicon chip with the heat sink. Today, thermal greases have to be qualified in lengthy stress tests in a product relevant environment which consumes substantial resources as often a system test is required. Therefore, a fast test is necessary which accelerates testing and thus allows a fast screening of market-available greases on one hand, and guidelines for material development on the other. For that purpose this paper addresses this topic in a combined simulative and experimental manner, where at the same time a novel test procedure is proposed for accelerated grease pump-out testing (GPOT) in the framework of a completely new approach, combining loading with in-situ failure analytical techniques and decoupling thermal from mechanical loading.<br/> &copy; IEEE / Therminic 2017.},

abstract = {The usage of open source (OS) software is wide-spread across many industries. While the functional quality of OS projects is considered to be similar to closed-source software, much is unknown about the quality in terms of performance. One challenge for OS developers is that, unlike for functional testing, there is a lack of accepted best practices for performance testing. To reveal the state of practice of performance testing in OS projects, we conduct an exploratory study on 111 Java-based OS projects from GitHub. We study the performance tests of these projects from five perspectives: (1) developers, (2) size, (3) test organization, (4) types of performance tests and (5) used tooling. We show that writing performance tests is not a popular task in OS projects: performance tests form only a small portion of the test suite, are rarely updated, and are usually maintained by a small group of core project developers. Further, even though many projects are aware that they need performance tests, developers appear to struggle implementing them. We argue that future performance testing frameworks should provider better support for low-friction testing, for instance via non-parameterized methods or performance test generation, as well as focus on a tight integration with standard continuous integration tooling. &copy; 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {In order to explore an energy-efficient thermal environment control model in greenhouse, based on heat pump technology, a new type of air-soil dual-source heat pump system matched with the greenhouse model was designed and built, and the system performance was also tested. This system was compounded of air source heat pump and soil source heat pump, and adopted the plate heat exchanger in series form. The air-soil dual-source heat pump system had four kinds of heating modes, including air source mode with single plate heat exchanger, air source mode with double plates heat exchanger, soil source mode with single plate heat exchanger and soil source mode with double plates heat exchanger. These working modes can be converted by controlling the on-off of the electromagnetic valve. The soil source heat pump mode can solve the adaptability problem of air source heat pump under low temperature condition, while the air source heat pump mode can alleviate the problem of imbalance of the acquisition and release of the soil source heat pump. In the winter and spring test period, the C<inf>OP</inf>(coefficient of performance) and temperature rise rate of the heat pump system in air source mode with single and double plates heat exchanger were tested by heating the water in the heat insulating water tank. The operation results in spring were better than that in winter. In spring, the C<inf>OP</inf>of the heat pump system in single and double plates air source mode were 2.1 and 3.1, respectively, and the C<inf>OP</inf>of the heat pump system in single and double plate soil source mode were 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. The energy-saving effect of air source mode with double plates heat exchanger was the most significant, the energy-saving rate was up to 50.4%. During the winter test period, the air source mode with double plates heat exchanger could raise the temperature in the greenhouse model in the typical sunny days. The indoor temperature was higher than the outdoor temperature about 15.7&#8451; on average. According to the results, the performance of the double plate heat exchanger was both better than that of the single plate heat exchanger during the winter and spring. The results also showed that both the amount of heating medium and system pressure can affect the effect of the dual-source heat pump system. In conclusion, this air-soil dual-source heat pump system can make use of air energy and geothermal energy efficiently to realize the energy conservation of solar greenhouse in winter.<br/> &copy; 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

abstract = {For the foreseeable future, fossil fuels will continue to be the dominant source of the world's primary energy production. There has been growing concern that the use of the carbon-based fuels produces greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>), which may adversely affect the global climate and environment. One way to mitigate the problem is to use carbon capture, transportation, and storage (CCTS) techniques and systems. As such, there is an increasing demand on corrosion inhibitors for CCTS application and also a need to understand the corrosion inhibitor performance above CO<inf>2</inf>critical point (30.98 &deg;C, 73.77 bar) as a single phase in the system which is a pre-condition for continuous operation at the so-called quasi-steady (QSSA) state. Therefore, the corrosion inhibitors for CCTS applications need to be specially formulated and evaluated under supercritical conditions of CO<inf>2</inf>. This paper discusses the design philosophy for corrosion inhibitors used for CCTS and the performance testing using rotating cylinder autoclave (RCA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods under CO<inf>2</inf>supercritical conditions with or without water and SO<inf>2</inf>as the major impurity in the system. &copy; 2017 by NACE International.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, or things, with embedded electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity. The connection of all these things leverages value generation, by offering new services and strategic information. In order to make the Internet of Things possible, the integration of many technologies is necessary, such as machine-To-machine and cyber-physical systems. The process of testing IoT applications introduces new challenges because it does not only includes typical test strategies and methodologies. Testing an IoT system depends on its the specific configuration, and it also needs to consider the hardware platform and the network environment. Currently, industry and academy efforts are focusing on usability and connectivity tests, such as: simulating the environment where the device is to be used, and ensuring information is exchanged in a secure manner. In this paper, we use the current version of our IoT platform to perform stress testing of our IoT platform under different conditions. Our test methodology for IoT applications is also presented. Three different hardware platforms have been used for performing the stress testing of our platform. Copyright &copy; 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract = {As a large scale passive pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant, CAP1400 can remove the reactor decay heat to outside containment with the air cooling in the air flow path of passive containment cooling system (PCS) during the longterm period following an accident. Flow resistance characteristic and wind neutrality characteristic are the main performances of PCS air flow path. In order to study the performance of PCS air flow path, it is necessary to carry out the PCS wind tunnel test and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to establish a suitable method for the analysis of the performance of the air flow path. This paper comes up simulating the internal pressure and velocity distribution in the air flow path under different wind speed through CAP1400 PCS 1:100 scaled air flow path wind tunnel test to research the air flow resistance and internal flow pattern. The test shows that local uneven flow phenomenon exists in the outer annulus of the air flow path, but the wind pressure distribution of inner annulus is not affected by environment wind speed, wind direction angle, landforms and the surrounding buildings. The wind pressure is uniform at different heights on the cross section and shows the neutrality feature. Combining with CAP1400 PCS wind tunnel test, the CFD model is built. The measured inlet wind speed, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate distribution parameters are inputs and the uniform wind conditions and gradient wind conditions of simulation analysis are developed. Simulation results show that: 1) In uniform wind condition, simulation result of pressure coefficient distribution trend at each cross section is consistent with the test trend and the deviation is very small, which basically can be controlled below 5%. The simulated differential pressures between inner annulus and outer annulus at different elevation are basically identical with the test results, which increase as the elevation arises. The simulated velocity distribution is basically identical with the test. The wind velocity at the upwind and central area of the flow path outlet is larger than other area, and a large swirling region comes on the leeward side near the wall 15cm, but simulated swirling region size at leeward side is slightly smaller. 2) In gradient wind condition, the pressure coefficient distribution trends are basically identical, and the deviation between the test and CFD analysis is 5-10% approximately. Considering the stability of gradient wind condition in wind tunnel is worse than that of uniform wind conditions, and more prone to wind speed fluctuations, therefore, the deviation is slightly greater than the uniform wind condition. According to the CFD simulation and wind tunnel test, it can be found that the simulation of air flow inside and outside annulus has a high precision though the test results are slightly affected by the instrument tubes along the two sides of test model. In general, CFD simulation and wind tunnel test results are basically identical. Therefore, CFD analysis method is well verified by PCS wind tunnel test, which can be applied to the analysis of the actual power plant.

abstract = {The technology of photoelectric inducing-trapping can kill agricultural insect (locust, ant, etc.) and protect the agricultural production from being destroyed effectively, and avoid the environment pollution caused by spraying pesticide. The key factor of this technology is to develop a kind of slippery trapping plate which can restrict insects' excellent attachment ability generated by rigid claw and adhesive pad. To obtain structural information for biomimetic developing the slippery trapping plate, surface morphology of bionic prototype (slippery zone of Nepenthes alata pitcher) was detailedly examined in August and September of 2013. Several sections (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) were cut from the slippery surface and rinsed in distilled water before being air-dried, then mounted on aluminum blocks and sputter coated, and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fresh sample (2 cm<sup>2</sup>) was cut from slippery surface and glued to an aluminum block, and examined with a scanning white-light interferometer (SWLI). The structural parameters of slippery surface were statistically acquired via analyzing the saved images with the software belonging to the SEM and SWLI equipment. The results showed that the slippery surface is covered by a layer of dense and irregular wax crystals, along with numerous downward-directed lunate cells. Length and thickness of the platelet-shaped wax crystals was 1109.6&plusmn;68.5 nm and 89.11&plusmn;5.17 nm, respectively; the height and interval distance of the lunate cells was 20.41&plusmn;1.73 &mu;m and 71.53&plusmn;3.86 &mu;m, respectively; the angles of the lunate cell's slope and precipice was 23.1&plusmn;2.4&deg; and 76.1&plusmn;4.0&deg;, respectively. These obtained parameters suggested that the slippery zone bears micro-nano scaled surface architectures. Based on acquired structural parameters, biomimetic model of the slippery trapping plate was designed with CAXA software. The biomimetic model consisted of a substrate and an epicuticular layer, the substrate was covered by micro-scaled triangular prisms (simplified lunate cells) and numerous blind holes, and the epicuticular layer was composed of massive flaky graphite (simplified wax coverings) possessing the physical properties of lubrication and slippage. To prepare the slippery trapping plate, laser micro-fabrication technology was adopted to machine the micro-scaled architectures (triangular prisms and blind holes) of the substrate (alloy steel, 100 mm&times;50 mm&times;5 mm, length&times;width&times;thickness), and high voltage electrostatic incorporation technology was used to attach the flaky graphite (mesh number 1500-2000, dimension 6.5-10 &mu;m) to the machined substrate. The flaky graphite was put on an organic glass box (95 mm&times;45 mm&times;30 mm, length&times;width&times;height); and put the laser-machined substrate and an alloy plate on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. The positive and negative electrode of high voltage electrostatic source was respectively connected to the substrate and alloy plate, and applied high voltage electrostatic (16.0-18.0 KV) for 100-120 s. With the incorporation of the high voltage electrostatic, the flaky graphite was absorbed to the blind holes of substrate and attached tightly. To test the function of the biomimetic slippery trapping plate, attachment forces of adult locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis) were measured with an insect micro-force measurement system in July 2015. The system mainly consisted of a force transducer (1-PW4C3), a signal conditioning module (SCXI-1520), a data acquisition platform (PCI-6221), and data-processing &amp; displaying software. The locust was connected to the force transducer (along load direction) using a thin thread (12 cm long) fastened its neck position, and then put on the tested surface. The locust climbed on the tested surface along the load direction of the force transducer. When the thin thread started to pull, the locust crawled ahead frantically to attempt to break away from this restriction, so generated attachment forces and their maximal values were recorded. The results showed that values of attachment force provided by locust on bionic slippery trapping plate ranged from 328.7 mN to 458.3 mN, whereas on slippery surface ranged from 307.3 mN to 397.1 mN. Attachment force of locust on bionic slippery trapping plate (402.9&plusmn;26.1 mN) was barely 1.1 times than that on slippery surface (361.9&plusmn;25.5 mN), suggesting the biomimetic slippery trapping plate bore rather similar function as the slippery surface, thereby achieved the protected biomimetic results. The obtained conclusion provides theoretical and technical references to biomimetic development of slippery trapping plate used for controlling agricultural insect. &copy;, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract = {The dynamic nature and limited work space of roadway work zones contribute to dangerous working environments for construction workers. This environment can result in hazardous proximity situations because pedestrian workers are required to operate in close proximity to heavy construction equipment. A total of 609 work zone personnel fatalities were reported in 2012. Previous analysis of work zone fatality data found that the majority of the pedestrian worker and mobile object struck-by fatalities resulted when pedestrian workers were struck by construction equipment. These statistics indicate that current safety practices for pedestrian workers and equipment operators are inadequate. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a proximity detection and alert system using Bluetooth sensing technology. The scope included hazardous proximity situations between pedestrian workers and construction equipment in roadway work zones at grade. Evaluation metrics were implemented to assess the tested proximity sensing systems including the cost, time and ease of calibration, required hardware, system capabilities, and many others. Commercially available radio frequency identification (RFID) and magnetic field proximity sensing systems were also evaluated to provide a basis for comparison. Various interaction scenarios between pedestrian workers and construction equipment were used in the evaluation of the system. The performance evaluation based on the statistical results showed that all the tested systems were considered reliable with minimal false alarm rates. However, the magnetic system showed a significant drop in its coverage range, while still providing reliable coverage measures, with a set of tests that were more dynamic than other sets of tests. The created Bluetooth system provided the highest level of simplicity with its minimized infrastructure, ease of calibration, and ease of installation. In sum, experimental results demonstrate that the created proximity detection and alert system (1) requires minimal infrastructure; (2) provides adequate alerts to equipment operators and pedestrian workers; and (3) provides, through an alert, an additional layer of hazard avoidance in real time during hazardous-proximity situations in roadway work zones. &copy; 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {In the development stage of electric vehicle drive, simulation plays a vital role. It's a powerful tool which allows the developer to investigate various control strategies and test hardware systems in harmless work environment. The software simulations platform does have constraints. In that the complex mathematical operations take longer time to solve and eventually increases the overall simulation time and cannot perform the real-time operation. This simulation further needs to be converted to the target processor's language, either assembly or C-language, which will operate in the drive system. However, if a real-time simulation environment could be comprehended, then the real processor used in the system could be incorporated in the simulation. This eventually will eliminate the chance of introducing error during code translation as well as reduce simulation time. Also, the target controller could be tested within the simulation before introducing it the actual system. This paper discuss a concept of controller-in-loop simulation, which can be used to simulate the entire system in real-time. A simple dynamic model of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink as well as on a TMS320F28069 digital signal processor from Texas Instruments Inc. Comparative study of simulation results of both the platforms, demonstrate that although MATLAB/Simulink provides excellent GUI and functionality, it fails to performs real-time simulation which can be accomplished with controller-in-simulation. &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

Model-based Testing is a technique for automatic generation of testing artifacts based on software models. One of the main benefits of using MBT is related to the easiness of maintaining models over code; hence, it is likely that using models as a source for automatic generation of scripts requires less effort and reduces the number of faults. Otherwise, CR-based tools basically record the user interaction with the System Under Test (SUT) and then playback the recorded test. This paper presents our effort on setting up and running an experimental study performed in order to evaluate the effort to use MBT and CR-based tools to generate performance scripts. Thus, we apply an MBT and a CR approaches for the purpose of evaluation with respect to the effort to generate scripts and scenarios from the perspective of the performance testers and the performance test engineers in the context of undergraduates, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students, performance testers and performance test engineers for the generation of performance test scripts and scenarios. Our results indicate that, for simple testing tasks, the effort of using a CR-based tool was lower than using an MBT tool, but as the complexity or size of the activities of the testing tasks increases, the advantage of using MBT increased significantly.<br/> &copy; 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Stress testing is used to measure the performance of the heart in an elevated stress state, in order to monitor or diagnose certain heart problems. Many measurements can be used to determine the performance of the heart, with the Tei index being the measurement of interest in this work. The Tei index has been used as a reliable method to evaluate systolic and diastolic performance, as it overcomes some limitations of the classical echocardiographic indices. It is calculated based on the time intervals derived from echocardiography. This paper presents an exploratory study, which uses an accelerometer to record mechanical events occurring in each cardiac cycle, also known as the seismocardiogram (SCG). From timing measurements corresponding to various events in the heart, a metric for myocardial performance is calculated based on the Tei index. The use of SCG in addition to ECG has the potential to provide further insights about the heart during stress testing, since the SCG quantifies mechanical actions of the heart. &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) Lifecycle Testing Laboratory is operated by the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI), which is dedicated to conducting life-cycle testing of electrically heated versions of the MMRTG. Since there are only two MMRTG electrically-heated thermoelectric generators (ETG) available for testing, a Test Plan Development Working Group was established to determine and prioritize the performance testing that is being conducted with the Engineering Unit (EU) and Qualification Unit (QU) ETGs. This working group is comprised of subject matter experts from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC), NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), UDRI, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Teledyne Energy Systems. The highest priority testing was concluded by the working group to be: 1) To determine the impact of thermal cycling on thermoelectric components by characterizing the evolution of the thermoelectric/electrical properties of the EU as a result of thermal cycling the ETG through a Martian Sol repeatedly; 2) to characterize the effect of a simulated cruise-phase environment on the QU by evaluating the change in performance of the ETG before and after a cruise-phase simulation; and 3) characterize and clear any potential MMRTG internal shorts to chassis by integrating the JPL derived active short technique between the internal electrical power circuit and chassis frame of the MMRTG. The data and risk mitigation techniques derived from this testing can potentially be incorporated into future missions that would employ the MMRTG or successor thermoelectric radioisotope power systems. &copy; 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract = {Planning, control, perception, and learning are current research challenges in multirobot systems. The transition dynamics of the robots may be unknown or stochastic, making it difficult to select the best action each robot must take at a given time. The observation model, a function of the robots' sensor systems, may be noisy or partial, meaning that deterministic knowledge of the team's state is often impossible to attain. Moreover, the actions each robot can take may have an associated success rate and/or a probabilistic completion time. Robots designed for real-world applications require careful consideration of such sources of uncertainty, regardless of the control scheme or planning or learning algorithms used for a specific problem. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of planning algorithms can be challenging due to the latent variables they often operate on. When performance testing such algorithms on hardware, the simultaneous use of the debugging and visualization tools available on a workstation can be difficult. This transition from experimentation to implementation becomes especially challenging when the experiments need to replicate some feature of the software tool set in hardware, such as simulation of visually complex environments. This article details a robotics prototyping platform, called measurable augmented reality for prototyping cyberphysical systems (MAR-CPS), that directly addresses this problem, allowing for the real-time visualization of latent state information to aid hardware prototyping and performance testing of algorithms. &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Software testing process has a high cost when compared to the other stages of software development. Automation of software testing through reuse of software artifacts (e.g. models) is a good alternative for mitigating these costs and making the process much more efficient and efficacious. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is a technique to automatic generation of testing artifacts based on software models. For software development, the most spread modeling language in either the industrial or academic environments is UML. In such environments, it is desirable to reuse UML models also for MBT. avoiding re-building a different model exclusively for testing automation. These are the main reasons that make these semi-formal models an alternative to implementing MBT. Even though there are a lot of testing tools available commercially, to the best of our knowledge, none of them fully uses MBT. Therefore, this paper describes a case study showing how to implement the MBT process to automate test scripts generation and execution in a real-world, context. Furthermore, our solution is generated automatically by a Software Product Line (SPL).<br/>},

The diesel generator sets power both the propulsion motors propelling the ship and provide the electrical power for the hotel loads of the ship. Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) was blended with the neat HRD fuel in a 50/50-by-volume blend and tested for over 440 hours on the vessel. Exhaust emissions testing was performed while underway on Lake Michigan using the baseline ULSD assessed earlier. A similar profile was run using the blended test fuel. Emission testing was conducted using the ISO 8178 (D2) test cycle. When emissions testing was completed a series of underway and pierside test runs were conducted to accumulate the remaining engine hours, After all testing, the engine conditions were assessed again using a combination of visual inspection and oil analysis. The remainder of the test fuel will be used to conduct a long-term stability test.

abstract = {The assessment of the local seismic response is one of the fundamental phases when it comes to defining the levels of seismic hazard at a detailed scale. These are typically known as seismic zonation studies. The estimation of the site specific resonance frequency is a parameter of relevant interest within such studies as it is associated with the maximum seismic amplification which has to be related to the frequency of resonance of buildings. The ambient noise based methods and other experimental methods for measuring this parameter are not always applicable because they are strongly influenced by contrasts of impedence and by lateral subsurface heterogeneities. Furthermore, they sometimes present limits that are not always clearly known. On the other hand, the classic analytical approach that makes use of integrated and multidisciplinary investigation methods, which estimate the local amplification parameters, mainly in terms of amplification factors and response spectrums, currently presents uncertainties and limitations. These are essentially associated with the difficulty of modelling the mechanisms of propagation of the seismic waves within a 3D system. The authors of this paper propose the experimental measurement of the site resonance frequency by means of Dynamic Load Testing (DLT). This is done by presenting the operative procedures, the data processing and the results obtained from a test undertaken at the experimental site of Fivizzano (Massa-Carrara, Italy) where a detailed study of the local seismic response was also undertaken. The test involved the delivery of sinusoidal forces with maximum amplitude of 20 kN and a range of frequencies between 0 and 15 Hz by means of an electro-mechanical generator. Simultaneous seismic monitoring was undertaken through a multichannel acquisition system. Velocimeters were placed on the ground and in a nearby strategic building. The measured frequency of resonance was compared to the predicted value obtained from empirical-analytical solutions and application of horizontal to vertical spectral ratios (HVSR) method and to the value measured by a seismic station equiped with two coupled accelerometers, one at the surface and one at depth; these sensors allowed an accurate analysis of the effects of the drift deposits overlying the bedrock, that is the transfer function of the stratigraphic column at the site.<br/>},

abstract = {Many modern power plants feature gas turbines with advanced control systems that allow a greater level of performance enhancements, over a broader range of the combined-cycle plant's operating environment, compared to conventional systems. Control system advancements tend to outpace a plant's construction and commissioning timescale. Often, the control algorithms and settings in place at the final guarantee performance test will differ significantly from those envisioned during the contract agreement phase. As such, the gas turbine's actual performance response to changes in boundary conditions, such as air temperature and air humidity, will be considerably different than the response illustrated on the initial correction curves. For the sake of technical accuracy, the performance correction curves should be updated to reflect the as-built, as-left behavior of the plant. By providing the most technically accurate curves, the needs of the new plant performance test are satisfied. Also, plant operators receive an accurate means to trend performance over time. The performance correction curves are intended to provide the most technically accurate assurance that the corrected test results are independent of boundary conditions that persist during the performance test. Therefore, after the gas turbine control algorithms and/or settings have been adjusted, the performance correction curves - whether specific to gas turbines or overall combined-cycle plants - should be updated to reflect any change in turbine response. This best practice maintains the highest level of technical accuracy. Failure to employ the available advanced gas turbine control system upgrades can limit the plant performance over the ambient operating regime. Failure to make a corresponding update to the correction curves can cause additional inaccuracy in the performance test's corrected results. This paper presents a high-level discussion of GE's recent gas turbine control system advancements, and emphasizes the need to update performance correction curves based on their impact.

abstract = {Measuring geomechanical properties of the caprock and shale gas reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or storage reservoirs has become an integral part of asset evaluation services. The steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process, as well as other EOR and storage applications (gas, nuclear waste, CO<inf>2</inf>), requires caprock integrity testing. Measuring in-situ stresses is an important input to caprock integrity solutions not only for the technical management of projects but also for environmental reasons. A Wireline Formation Testing (WFT) tool is one of the commonly used techniques used for direct measurement of the minimum in-situ stress at different depths. The process is commonly called a mini-frac or micro-frac and is typically performed in an openhole wellbore. A suitable tool string includes a straddle packer arrangement, downhole pump, gamma ray sonde for depth correlation, motorized valves, and pressure gauges. To perform a stress test, an interval of the wellbore is isolated by inflating me straddle packer arrangement. The interval is then pressurized by pumping fluid until a tensile fracture is initiated. In an open hole, the fracture initiates and propagates normal to the minimum stress. Multiple injection and fall-off cycles are performed to ensure fracture growth beyond the hoop stress regime. The data is analyzed to determine fracture initiation pressure, fracture propagation, and closure pressure. This paper describes the process of minimum in-situ stress measurement using a WFT. Lessons leamt over the years and best practices are highlighted along with their importance for proper job planning. Case studies of WFT testing including SAGD caprock stress testing from Canadian fields are presented and discussed. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.<br/>},

abstract = {This paper presents the reliability-based resistance factor calibration of driven steel pipe piles and the implementation of Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) on practical design cases. Resistance factors of driven steel pipe piles were calibrated in the framework based on reliability theory using static pile load test results. The results of fifty seven load tests conducted to failure were compiled and these 57 data were divided into three different groups based on their data quality. For the three groups, reliability analyses were performed for two static bearing capacity equations and for different target reliability indices (2.0 and 2.33 for group piles and 2.5 for single piles) following the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) and using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). It is noted that the resistance factors were highly dependent on the quality of load test data. To implement the calibrated resistance factors, a case study on an actual bridge foundation design was performed. The case study result showed that, for the given target reliability index, the developed LRFD method using the resistance factors calibrated in this study could contribute to cost savings when it is compared with Allowable Stress Design (ASD) case using a safety factor of 3.0. &copy; 2013 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Quantum effects play a crucial role in chemical reactions involving light atoms at low temperatures, especially when a light particle is exchanged between two heavier partners. Different theoretical methodologies have been developed in the last decades attempting to describe zero-point energy and tunneling effects without abandoning a classical or semiclassical framework. In this work, we have chosen the D + HMu &rarr; DMu + H reaction as a stress test system for three well-established methods: two representative versions of transition state theory (TST), canonical variational theory and semiclassical instanton, and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). These calculations will be compared with accurate quantum mechanical results. Despite its apparent simplicity, the exchange of the extremely light muonium atom (0.114 u) becomes a most challenging reaction for conventional methods. The main result of this work is that RPMD provides an overall better performance than TST-based methods for such a demanding reaction. RPMD might well turn out to be a useful tool beyond TST applicability.<br/> &copy; 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {When modernizing systems there are big risks concerning functional and non-functional properties. It is expected that the functionality, the performance and the dependability are the same (or better) in the new version. Therefore, the preventive workload simulation (to verify non-functional properties) is crucial to guarantee the success of the modernization project. Since tools for load simulation work at protocol level, the automation of tasks for workload simulation demand much more effort than functional testing, whose test cases are designed using record and playback techniques on the GUI: these tools are more intuitive and they have to handle less variables and technical issues. In this article we present a tool to automatically generate workload simulation scripts from automated functional tests. The tool has been used in several projects in the industry, achieving important cost savings and improving flexibility when verifying non-functional properties of a migrated system. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.<br/>},

A key element of the ASRG Project is providing life, reliability, and performance testing of the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC). For this purpose, four pairs of ASCs capable of operating to 850&deg;C and designated with the model number ASC-E2, were delivered by Sunpower of Athens, OH, to GRC in 2010. The ASC-E2s underwent a series of tests that included workmanship vibration testing, performance mapping, and extended operation. Workmanship vibration testing was performed following fabrication of each convertor to verify proper hardware build. Performance mapping consisted of operating each convertor at various conditions representing the range expected during a mission. Included were conditions representing beginning-of-mission (BOM), end-of-mission (EOM), and fueling. This same series of tests was performed by Sunpower prior to ASC-E2 delivery. The data generated during the GRC test were compared to performance before delivery. Extended operation consisted of a 500-hour period of operation with conditions maintained at the BOM point. This was performed to demonstrate steady convertor performance following performance mapping. Following this initial 500-hour period, the ASC-E2s will continue extended operation, controller development and special durability testing, during which the goal is to accumulate tens of thousands of hours of operation. Data collected during extended operation will support reliability analysis. Performance data from these tests is summarized in this paper.<br/>},

Such tests were also applied in the financial sector following the recent economic crisis to test the robustness of banks in the event of an extreme adverse economic scenario. Drawing on some lessons from other industries, this paper examines some of the challenges and limitations of stress testing, and discusses some of the potential benefits, and how these tests could be related to existing risk assessment and management practices in the oil and gas industry. &copy; 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, London.<br/>},

abstract = {This paper introduces a comprehensive full-scale pile load test program on 457-mm (18-in.) square prestressed concrete (PSC) piles in Savannah, Georgia. The program consisted of pile driving analyzer testing during initial pile driving and restrikes, Statnamic tests, static axial compression load tests, and reciprocal lateral load tests. On the basis of the interpretation of the test data, some important findings were obtained: (1) the alluvial clays in Savannah can only provide very limited resistance; (2) the time-dependent pile capacity gain after pile driving (i.e., setup effect) was approximately proportional to the pile embedment length into the Marl formation; (3) the estimated equivalent static pile capacities from the Statnamic tests were comparable to those from the static axial load tests; (4) the Marl formation is a competent bearing stratum for piles; (5) the potential degradation of pile concrete stiffness caused by pile driving should be accounted for in pile capacity analysis; and (6) the piles exhibited stiffer response under the monotonic lateral loading condition than the cyclic lateral loading condition. Finally, predictions on both axial and lateral pile capacities, using the soil parameters derived from the instrumentation data and back-analysis of the pile load tests, were compared with the corresponding pile load test results. The comparisons demonstrate that in combination of the static-bearing capacity formulas and the LPILE program, the developed soil models can make reliable predictions on both the vertical and lateral behaviors of the PSC piles driven through the soft alluvial clays to end bearing in the Marl formation. &copy; 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.<br/>},

abstract = {Due to the complex working environment and relatively backward manufacturing technology, an important industrial tool, the air winch, faces lots of problems such as wire rope breaking and brake instability. This paper presents a new mechanical loading tower type air winch performance test platform designed to test air winch after it is manufactured. In order to ensure security during the test, this paper proceeded with numerical analysis for the bracket. Results of the analysis showed: the maximum stress of the bracket when loadedwas10tat 156MPa which was far below its yield stress, and its maximum displacement was0.527mm,which would not produce large deformation. The natural frequencies of the bracket's free mode are smooth sequential which do not exist in local breakpoint, and the interval of each frequency is large, thus it can avoid the close mode. Because the first mode frequency is 37.255Hz, so the bracket can avoid resonance caused by the vibration of the system due to the instability of the gas source during the test. This paper also analyzed the stress of the bracket during the test to help the operator predict the danger point and prevent the occurrence of overload. In addition to introducing a new mechanical loading tower type air winch performance test platform, the authors also present a detailed analysis of the bracket. The new test platform can effectively compensate for the lack of air winch performance testing in domestic manufacturing. &copy; ASCE 2013.<br/>},

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been adopted to track items in supply chain, healthcare, and manufacturing applications. Hospitals and factories, however, are difficult environments for radiowave propagation. Cinder block walls with steel rebar, metal obstructions, and RF noise present significant obstacles to RFID system performance. Tagging lossy materials in these environments, such as metals and liquids, can also degrade the performance of RFID systems. In a previous paper [1] we simulated the RF-harsh conditions prevalent in these environments to evaluate UHF RFID system performance. In this paper, we utilize the same laboratory environment to measure RFID system performance when RF-harsh materials are tagged. These tests serve to examine the effect of water and plastic car parts on RFID system performance in an RF harsh environment. We show that the problems posed when tagging RF-harsh materials can be mitigated with either the strategic placement of tags on the item, or the careful choice of tags. While UHF RFID systems can be used in the presence of RF-harsh circumstances, the system architecture must be carefully tested in order to minimize the effects of performance-hindering RF obstacles. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

The complete system was designed to operate by using one servo motor only. The system model was developed in SolidWorks and tested for different kinematic and dynamic performances. The performance of the gripper and cutting tool system has been evaluated through simulation to determine the design parameters of practical prototype. Based on the design concept, practical prototype of the gripper and cutting system was developed by considering the results obtained by model developed in SolidWorks. The developed prototype was tested to verify the feasibility and reliability of the model developed in Solid- Works. The performance and practical application of the developed prototype was verified and validated by conducting experiments in the lab and greenhouse and comparing the results with simulation results.},

abstract = {DC urban railway power system consists of DC power network and AC power network. The DC power network supplies electric power to railway vehicles and the AC power network supplies electric power to station electric equipment. Recently, because of power consumption reduction and peak load shaving, intelligent measurement of regenerative energy and renewable energy adapted on DC urban railway is required. For this reason, DC smart metering system for DC power network shall be developed. Therefore, in this paper, DC voltage sensor, current sensor, and DC smart meter were developed and evaluated by performance test. DC voltage sensor was developed for measuring standard voltage range of DC urban railway, and DC current sensor was developed as hall effect split core type in order to install in existing system. DC smart meter possesses function of general intelligent electric power meter, such as measuring electricity and wireless communication etc. And, DC voltage sensor showed average 0.17% of measuring error for 2,000V/50mA, and current sensor showed average 0.21% of measuring error for &plusmn;2,000V/&plusmn;4V in performance test. Also DC smart meter showed maximum 0.92% of measuring error for output of voltage sensor and current sensor. In similar, environment for real DC power network, measuring error rate was under 0.5%. In conclusion, accuracy of DC smart metering system was confirmed by performance test, and more detailed performance will be verified by further real operation DC urban railway line test.<br/>},

abstract = {Performance modeling is an important step in the lifecycle of a typical Web-based multi-tier application. However, while most practitioners are comfortable carrying out load tests on a Web application on a testbed, they find sophisticated performance modeling tools difficult to use because many inputs required by them are difficult to obtain. Chief among these is the service times of various types of requests at various resources in the multi-tier system (e.g. CPU execution time required at the Web server by a \Login" request). In this paper, we present PerfCenterLite, a tool focused on ease of use for practitioners of performance analysis. The tool (a) provides a spread-sheet template for describing the application architecture and (b) accepts standard performance metrics obtained from load testing of the application. PerfCenterLite then uses mathematical estimation techniques and transforms this input into a full-edged performance model as required by a sophisticated performance modeling tool. Validation experiments show that performance metrics predicted using PerfCenterLite match well with measured values. &copy; Copyright 2015 ICST.},

abstract = {Web applications are increasingly resorting to public cloud platforms such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). However, previous studies have shown that the virtualized infrastructures used in a cloud environment can introduce performance issues. Hence, it is crucial to test the performance of the cloud to support Web applications. This is challenging because the performance effect of the cloud platform cannot be easily isolated from other extraneous factors. In this paper, we present a systematic experimental process to address this challenge. Following our proposed process, we test the performance of Web applications running on different types of AWS EC2 instances. Results suggest that Web server response times can fluctuate up to 1000% for the same workload under certain circumstances such as instance type, time-of-the-day, and day-of-the-week. &copy; 2014 IEEE.<br/>},

The results showed that most banks continue to profit even at 90% confidence level when estimated risk of loss, reflecting a moderate credit risk in the banking system. However, if confidence level rises to 99% when estimated risk of loss, the banking system will face significant losses.

The required experimental facility consists of a large capacity strong floor and wall reaction assembly along with servo-controlled electro-hydraulic actuators for the load application. One such testing facility is nearing completion at IIT Kanpur, which has 15 m&times;10 m L-shaped and 10.5 m high reaction wall and 1.2 m thick top slab of the box girder for the strong floor. The anchor points are located in the wall and floor in a square grid of 0.6 m with each point has load capacity of 1.7 MN in tension and 1.0 MN in shear. The 2 m thick post-tensioned wall using Freyssinet 12K15 cable system in a novel configuration can resist an overturning moment of 12.7 MNm per meter of the wall. The capacity of the reaction assembly depends upon number of loads applied, combination of loads, and interaction between different components of the reaction assembly structure. A methodology based on "influence coefficients" was developed to estimate the worst load combination for describing the load rating of the reaction structure. Finite element analyses in Abaqus environment was conducted to compute the influence coefficients matrix whose elements can be added linearly to find out the maximum loading effect on the structure which can be used to determine the limiting load for a particular case of load application.},

As a shielding coating, the resistance of a high-integrity three-layer coating to disbondment in damaged areas and as a function of applied cathodic potential is of interest with regard to the creation of an environment on the pipe that will support corrosion and/or cracking. The cathodic disbondment (CD) behavior of a multi-component powder coating system has been characterized under simulated field conditions (restrictive mass transport using soils), rather than the standard CSA protocol. The asreceived coating displayed excellent impedance properties and minimal disbondment under normal operating conditions. Coated panels were furthermore subjected to impact damage and a hot water soak prior to the CD tests. Results showed minimal disbondment of the multi-component powder coating system over 3 to 6 months regardless of impact damage or temperature. There was some evidence that more negative potentials may increase the disbondment area over longer periods of time. However, mechanistic considerations, literature information, experimental observations and field experiences would suggest that coating disbondment might be limited when the coating is properly applied and otherwise in good condition. Longer-term experiments are required to confirm the presence of a maximum size disbondment. Copyright &copy; 2006 by ASME.},

abstract = {Tapping and drilling are frequently used in mechanical working. Previous research on tapping and drilling has mainly focused on cutting force variations, drill and tap wearing, and drill and tap design: machine tool performance has seldom been dealt with. A novel performance test system of tapping and drilling for a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool is established in the current paper. This system includes a two-dimensional position sensing detector, a laser source, and a laser interferometer. The laser source was fixed on the spindle of the machine tool by the cutter, and the position sensing detector was mounted on the machine tool table. The reflecting mirror of the interferometer was fixed on the z axis of the machine tool, and the laser source of the laser interferometer was mounted on the machine tool table. Therefore, the spindle errors and the z axis position of the machine tool could be recorded by the position-sensing detector and laser interferometer respectively. Consequently the spindle error and z axis motion of the machine tool in the tapping/drilling test could be measured simultaneously. The accuracy of this system in the x-, y-, and z-directions was about 1 &mu;m in each case. The present paper describes the experiments of the position-sensing detector calibration, stability test, tapping test, and drilling test. The findings are discussed below. &copy; IMechE 2006.},

abstract = {Accelerated environmental stress tests (EST) are applied during the manufacturing process to improve reliability by precipitating and detecting latent defects. This test represents an in-process manufacturing screen and the objective of performing it is to avoid early field failures that reduce the customer satisfaction level and increase warranty and compensation costs. Temperature cycling during EST is one of the most commonly used test procedures. Although it is an expensive and energy intensive procedure, usually a lengthy test is initially recommended for a new product. Based on the product test performance or a possible manufacturing process modification, the test duration and regime may be changed after some period. Even if the number of test cycles is reduced, EST continues to be an expensive test and a major process bottleneck. This paper uses Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) to investigate the effects of the production and EST test variables on the population under test. Both the number of units rejected and the time to failure can be modeled as a regression function of covariates representative of the test environment. The field reliability function is written as a product of the unconditional reliability in each segment of the test profile such as dwell, ramp, etc. The next step is to apply the result of the temperature cycle EST GLM to a mathematical cost model. This cost model includes both the test cost and the warranty and compensation costs of the early field failures. The optimum test regime and number of cycles, which minimizes the total cost is determined by combining the GLM and the cost model. In this way the production test regime can be optimized in terms of field reliability/test cost trade-off. &copy; 2008 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Knowledge about minimum in-situ stress gradient of various intervals is essential to accurately predict stimulation treatment pressures, net pressure development and fracture height growth. Though several techniques are available to estimate this stress value, often times the analysis is performed in cased holes using surface measurements of rate and pressure which decreases the accuracy of the estimated stress values due to near wellbore storage effects, perforation to fracture misalignment, etc. Commonly employed pump rates and volumes also result in relatively large fractures which could break out of zone if the formation of interest is thin. Additionally, in vertically complex, low permeability intervals such as shales this can result in long decline periods that evidence multiple closure signatures making interpretation quite difficult. In addition, if reservoirs are being developed with horizontal wells, testing in uncased pilot holes is the only option to derive this information. This paper discusses the use of downhole injection stress testing to quantify fracture closure stress. Using this technique the injection and measurement of pressure is done downhole at the zone of interest thereby minimizing near wellbore effects and increasing the accuracy of the measurements. Stress testing is possible over very small intervals isolated with openhole packers using a wireline conveyed tool string. The intervals to be tested are determined from open hole logs run prior to testing. Multiple intervals can be stress tested on a single trip into the hole and several injection-decline cycles can be performed at each depth to bracket the range of closure stress for each of the tested intervals. Validation of the interpretation is enhanced via post-injection formation image logging which identifies the fractures created. Downhole injection stress testing has been performed on multiple wells in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale. Closure stress in various facies within the Barnett Shale and in bounding intervals has been measured. From these tests a better understanding of hydraulic fracture height growth has been acquired. Optimum landing points of horizontal laterals to best control fracture height growth and minimize fracture initiation issues have also been identified. This paper reviews the tool string utilized in this procedure, the methodology for selecting the intervals to be tested, the testing technique, and the data interpretation procedure.

The performance test for MFWs is then introduced in the paper. Test results and the engineering application show that the MFW not only has the function of lighting, ventilating and enclosing, but also has satisfactory performance on heat insulation, sound insulation, dust-preventing, keeping mosquito and theft out, and improving the air quality indoors.},

The ASRG will use General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules as the energy source and Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASCs) to convert heat into electrical energy, and is being developed by Lockheed Martin under contract to the Department of Energy. Achieving flight status mandates that the ASCs satisfy design as well as flight requirements to ensure reliable operation during launch. To meet these launch requirements, GRC performed a series of quasi-static mechanical tests simulating the pressure, thermal, and external loading conditions that will be experienced by an ASC-E2 heater head assembly. These mechanical tests were collectively referred to as "lateral load tests" since a primary external load lateral to the heater head longitudinal axis was applied in combination with the other loading conditions. The heater head was subjected to the operational pressure, axial mounting force, thermal conditions, and axial and lateral launch vehicle acceleration loadings. To permit reliable prediction of the heater head's structural performance, GRC completed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) computer modeling for the stress, strain, and deformation that will result during launch. The heater head lateral load test directly supported evaluation of the analysis and validation of the design to meet launch requirements. This paper provides an overview of each element within the test and presents assessment of the modeling as well as experimental results of this task.<br/>},

The Mock-up test facility with a full-scale reaction tube is an approximately 1/30-scale model of the HTTR hydrogen production system and an electric heater is used as a heat source instead of a reactor. After its construction, a performance test of the test facility was carried out in the same pressure and temperature conditions as those of the HTTR hydrogen production system to investigate its performance such as hydrogen production ability, controllability and so on. It was confirmed that hydrogen was stably produced with a hot helium gas about 120m <sup>3</sup>/h, which satisfy the design value, and thermal disturbance of helium gas during the start-up could be mitigated within the design value by using a steam generator. The mock-up test of the HTTR hydrogen production system using this facility will continue until 2004.},

To predict the behavior of a casting component under service conditions, value-added functionality has also been integrated into engineering software by linking solutions together and adding multi-physics analyses into the design cycle. The structural simulation of safety components made of die cast alloys is frequently based on the assumption of a homogenous distribution of mechanical properties. In reality defects caused by the production process like porosity is one of the most degrading factors leading to non-homogenous mechanical properties. In order to predict the behavior of the part under service conditions, it is necessary to take into account the influence of the porosity distribution resulting from the casting process into the structural simulation. This production part is then used in a performance analysis, such as crash or impact, to observe how the as-cast part will perform in its actual usage. This paper describes a methodology to model the complete High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) process, determine macro and micro porosity results and then map these porosity results onto a geometry which can be used for a crash/impact analysis. The porosity map leads to a more correct description of the mechanical strength of the component, which then leads to more accurate virtual component testing. These results will be compared to the experimentally measured porosity distribution in the actual part, as well as actual loading cases to observe the deflection and failure of the component. This type of advanced technology and predictive engineering is the next giant step in the software industry.<br/>},

abstract = {Aging is a matter of increasing concern for most bridges that are part of the road and railway systems of the European Union. Many of these bridges are very old bridges without documentation. A possible way to assess their capacity is by means of a proof load test. Two main questions should be solved when facing the execution of such a test: a) Which is the load level that the bridge should resist during the proof test to guarantee a predetermined service load with a required and appropriate safety level? and b) When the increase of loading should stop in order to not damage the structure? The answer to these questions is part of the task of the EC 6th Framework Programme European Project ARCHES (Assessment and Rehabilitation of Central European Highway Structures). In the project a methodology of proof load testing for existing bridges in new member states will be proposed. The paper shows the basis of the method as well as the application to an existing bridge located in Barcza (Poland). The bridge should be removed in the next future and therefore the proposed methodology can be fully checked. &copy; 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, London.<br/>},

Helical Flux Compression Generators (HFCGs) are attractive for single shot applications due to their rapid conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy. Midsized generators occupy little total volume (&tilde;4,000-cm<inf>3</inf>total with a compressible volume of &tilde;300-cm<inf>3</inf>in the present generator design), while the high explosives used in an HFCG provide an energy density of &tilde;8,000 MJ/m<inf>3</inf>. Consistent output current and energy gain from shot to shot are key variables in the ability of an HFCG to drive CPPSs effectively. An investigation into the practicality of using mid-sized HFCGs as the driver for single shot CPPSs is presented. Data and waveforms from generators fired into 3&mu;H inductive loads are shown, with results measuring the generator's performance as a driver for an inductive energy storage (IES) system. Results are also shown from adding a power conditioning system to the output of the HFCG, where the measurements demonstrate the ability of an HFCG to drive high impedance loads. The effectiveness of a mid-sized HFCG as drivers for these systems will be evaluated. &copy; 2007 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Active and passive vibration isolation mounts which can be used to locally isolate vibration generating mechanisms from the rest of the satellite have been addressed by many researchers. However, with few exceptions, only passive isolation technology has been accepted by satellite designers as mature for space applications. This paper describes the testing of an active/passive vibration isolation and steering system (VISS) which can be used to isolate a precision payload from spacecraft borne disturbances. VISS is a complicated device which is designed to work in a zerog environment. Because of its high mechanical compliance, testing on the ground in a one-g field is a serious concern. The VISS payload will therefore be off-loaded during the ground performance testing. The base of VISS is attached to a composite structure which is, in turn, attached to the host satellite. The flexible body dynamics of the composite structure will be approximated as will the rigid body dynamics of the entire satellite. This paper will discuss the design of the ground test hardware to be used in the VISS performance testing as well as some initial test results. &copy; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1996.

The SCR is a dual passage, monogroove heat pipe radiator designed and manufactured by Grumman Aerospace for NASA. The heat pipe has many aerospace applications since it can transport a large amount of heat with a compact lightweight design. As the micro-meteoroid/orbital debris environment worsens, it may be advantageous to add the heat pipe radiator to the Space Station's thermal control system. The SCR Life Test has been operating over the last 10 years and will continue until the year 2000. The overall heat transfer coefficient has decreased from 792 W/K (1500 Btu/Hr-&deg;F) to 475 W/K (900 Btu/Hr-&deg;F) but appears to have stabilized.

As for PC-based electrocardiographs, three examples of the MRT systems, two examples of the 300 Hz CardioScope model and one prototype of the 1200 Hz CardioScope were examined but only results for one representative example of each are given here. It was of particular interest to compare the performance advantages and limitations of the PC-based electrocardiographs with that of instruments currently in use. A test procedure was developed that can be used by a medical technical department to evaluate an electrocardiograph before making a purchase decision. The procedure includes tests of frequency response, sampling rate, 50 Hz filter attenuation, gain and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) plus tests based upon simulated electrocardiograms (ECGs). The procedure takes account of the AHA and ECRI recommendations for electrocardiograph checks and can be completed in less than two hours. The only equipment required being an ECG simulator and a signal generator. The results of this work show that purpose-built electrocardiographs meet all normal performance requirements, whereas the PC-based types, whilst having the potential to at least equal these requirements, currently exhibit software and hardware related problems.},

It was developed by HSE's Safety Engineering Laboratory primarily for use in the coal-mining industry as an alternative to gravimetric sampling. Up to eight dust monitors can be controlled by a microcomputer via a two-wire telemetry link at distances of up to 8 km. The paper reports the results of comparative tests between OSIRIS and the MRE 113A gravimetric sampler in a calm air dust box, in a wind tunnel and in field trials at two collieries. Results show that OSIRIS can be calibrated against the MRE 113A for a given dust and that the calibration is maintained over the normal working range of 0-40 mg m<sup>-3</sup>. Results of tests against a variety of available test dusts show that the physical and optical properties of the dust particles have a significant effect on the response of the instrument. OSIRIS therefore needs to be calibrated against a gravimetric sampler for each dust which it will be used to monitor. Once calibrated, OSIRIS would be useful in monitoring respirable dust concentrations in a wide range of industrial or laboratory situations.},

This arrangement offers a practical alternative to the motor-generator sets usually employed for load testing. The required equipment consists of a set of power reactors approximating 10% of the drive rating, a contactor and a phase locked loop circuit for regulating the drive phase relative to the line. The static dynamometer is in production use on variable speed drives from 20 to 5000 hp and 480 to 4160 V. There are no intrinsic limits to either power or voltage for its application.},

The simulated thermal environment was 60 BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>-sec for 90 seconds at ambient pressure followed by 160 seconds of thermal soaking. Based on the primary constituents, these low temperature ablative (LTA) materials were grouped into cork-based and silicone foam materials. The cork-based materials with epoxy or phenolic resin smoked and combusted during the high heat environment and swelled significantly as they charred. The combustion of cork and resin to form weakened char was the single most important degradation path of such heatshield materials. The finely cracked top surface is a characteristic of all cork based materials and was observed on most posttest samples. One of our new cork phenolic materials produced rigid char and ablated smooth. Replacing the epoxy and phenolic resins with silicone also minimized the combustion issues. Additionally, the silicone foam material produced smooth rigid char and the ablation rate was approximately equal to the swelling rate, resulting in minimal shape change. The main disadvantages of silicone-based thermal protection system (TPS) materials are the relatively high cost and more involved installation process. &copy; 1997 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

abstract = {Performance of many Web sites depends on the load on the site at peak time under varying conditions. Performance testing is normally conducted in reasonably simulated environment with the help of performance testing tools. However, performance of a Web site depends on various parameters and each parameter must be tested under varying stress levels. It is not possible to draw a common denominator for performance parameters to test the Web site due to complexity of Web sites. Different parts of the Web site must be tested with different parameters under varying condition and stress level. In such circumstances, it is necessary to decompose the Web site into many components, which represents the behavior of various business components. These business components are mapped to various objects that truly represent the behavior and structure of the part of the web site. These objects are subjected to performance testing with different parameters and stress levels. This paper addresses the new testing process, which uses the concept of decomposing the behavior of the Web site into testable components, which are mapped onto testable objects. These testable objects are subjected to performance testing under varied performance parameters and stress levels. &copy; 2000 IEEE.},

The experiments were performed in a controlled environment chamber configured to resemble an interior zone of a modern office building with modular workstation furniture and partitions. Velocity and temperature distributions were measured at six heights throughout the test chamber for each test configuration. Tests were conducted to investigate the effects of supply volume, supply location, supply direction, supply/return temperature difference, heat load density, and workstation size and layout. Temperature differences in the range of 1&deg;C to 2.5&deg;C between adjacent workstations were observed, and stratification in the room was strongly dependent on the supply air volume. The jet flow characteristics of the floor supply outlets produced high velocities in their immediate vicinity, increasing the risk of draft discomfort in these regions. However, by controlling the volume and trajectory of the supply air entering the space, office workers were able to control their local environment over a wide range, giving them the opportunity to fine-tune the thermal conditions in their workstation to their personal comfort preferences.},

abstract = {The luxury of employing extensive flight tests to determine the performance of modern airborne reconnaissance systems and their components is no longer an acceptable option for performance engineers and test managers. Because of the sophistication of modern aircraft, flight test costs have escalated to such an extent that suitable alternatives have had to be found. During recent years, the development and use of flight simulators and simulation techniques have been strongly encouraged throughout the Air Force. As a result, the Dynamic Analyzer Complex at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio was conceived, fabricated and placed in service. Today, this facility provides the Air Avionics Laboratory the wherewithal needed to conduct comprehensive reconnaissance system testing with minimum use of flight test aircraft.},

abstract = {An investigation in the Langley 16-Foot Transonic Tunnel has been conducted in which a laser velocimeter was used to measure free-stream velocities from Mach 0. 1 to 1. 0 and the flow velocities along the stagnating streamline of a hemisphere-cylinder model at Mach 0. 8 and 1. 0. The flow velocity was also measured at Mach 1. 0 along the line 0. 533 model diameters below the model. These tests determined the performance characteristics of the dedicated two-component laser velocimeter at flow velocities up to Mach 1. 0 and the effects of the wind tunnel environment on the particle-generating system and on the resulting size of the generated particles. To determine these characteristics, the measured particle velocities along the stagnating streamline at the two Mach numbers were compared with the theoretically predicted gas and particle velocities calculated lusing a transonic potential flow method.},

abstract = {Recent advances in electronics and testing techniques have made the smaller Fourier analyzer test systems much more attractive as a more portable, more flexible alternative to large, rack-mounted minicomputer-based test systems. This paper reviews numerous experimental tests performed in structural dynamics and operating performance by mechanical engineers in terms of their speed, data base size, calculation complexity, and transducer interface requirements, in an attempt to clarify the position of the smaller test system in the mechanical engineering test profession.},
