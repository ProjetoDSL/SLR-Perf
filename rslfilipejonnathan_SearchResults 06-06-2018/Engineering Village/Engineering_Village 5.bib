abstract = {The advancement of the design of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) beyond the conceptual phase, passes through the analysis of the impact of uncertainties, notably to what concerns safety-related conditions. Compliancy of plant safety to Design Extension Conditions is, according to IAEA and in line with the meaning itself of these beyond-design conditions, usually investigated by best estimates only. Due however to the demonstration nature of ALFRED, it was decided to assess the actual safety performances of this system even in ultimate conditions. To this regard, the emphasis was put on unprotected events like the UTOP (unprotected transient of over-power) and ULOOP (unprotected loss of offsite power, resulting from the combination of a loss of flow and loss of heat sink under unprotected conditions), pinpointed as the most challenging situations sought for the plant. The purpose of the present work, which has been divided in three parts, was then to assess the ultimate ALFRED safety margins against failure of the key core components and systems (Part III). To target this objective, the evaluation of uncertainties coming, on one hand, from nuclear data was performed at first, to retrieve their impact on the reactivity coefficients, thereby on the transient behavior driven by the latter (Part I); then, uncertainties from material properties, fabrication procedures, operation and measurement, and computational tools were propagated to assess their influence on the thermal-hydraulics of the system (Part II). In this work the efforts of Parts I and II are merged together and the effect of uncertainties on safety margins and salient parameters assessed. The retrieved uncertainties are propagated to the expected number of pins experiencing fuel melting during an UTOP and to the clad time-to-failure during an ULOOP. The former has been found to be quite affected by uncertainties, but still under limits not directly posing hazards to the people and the environment, even when extremely conservative assumptions are put forward; the latter shows a milder response to uncertainties, but always guaranteeing more than an order of magnitude of safety margin relative to WENRA recommendations.<br/> &copy; 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The performance of steam generators to generate high-temperature steam using waste heat from industrial processes was investigated. Two types of steam generators were constructed. One is a bench-scale cylindrical generator having similar structure to the laboratory-scale reactor used in the authors&rsquo; previous research. The other is a scaled-up generator whose flow passage area is extended to store a large amount of adsorbent for further scale-up on practical application. Temperature measurements in the bench-scale generator in the atmospheric steam generation process showed that a high-temperature region is formed above the water level due to adsorption of water vapor, while a low-temperature region below saturation temperature is formed below the water level. The mass of steam generate d per unit mass of adsorbent increased with increasing energy supplied from the regeneration air and approached an asymptotic value depending on the temperature of the regeneration air. The mass of steam generated per unit mass of adsorbent increased with decreasing heat capacity of the generator.<br/> &copy; 2018 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.},

abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 standard has become the basis of one of the most successful wireless communication technologies of all time. Originally created to provide wireless connectivity for a few devices, a couple of decades later it may support thousands of users in a single wireless LAN. This fact has made 802.11 a relevant research topic, and as it happens with other wireless technologies, many of the work carried out is based on simulations. In particular, studies for scenarios with high user density are usually performed this way, in many cases leading to conclusions which do not apply to real world situations. This mismatch can be due to multiple factors, such as the specific protocol implementations or the hardware and drivers used. In this article we present a novel 802.11-based testing platform, which aims to bridge the gap between simulations and the real world, in order to carry out research work for typical high density scenarios. The platform is compatible with standard 802.11-based wireless cards on the market and it was tested with two different radios, The validation metrics considered were the TCP throughput, the airtime utilization and the effective data rate, with relative errors ranging from 0 up to 15%. The potential of the tool is illustrated with real world measurements from two example use cases in education facilities: a school classroom and a conference room. The results indicate this might be the first step towards an open platform to enable active Wi-Fi performance testing for large scale scenarios. Further emulation capabilities are shown with different application tests already integrated to the platform, such as QoE tests for YouTube video playback or e-learning platforms.<br/> &copy; 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The steady state performance of a 6-cell short stack of yttria (Y<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>) stabilised zirconia (YSZ) with Ni/YSZ anodes and composite Sr-doped lanthanum manganite (LaMnO<inf>3</inf>, LSM)/YSZ cathodes is experimentally evaluated. In Part A, the stack characterisation is carried out by means of sensitivity analyses on the fuel utilisation factor and the steam-to-carbon ratio. Electrical and environmental performances are assessed and the results are compared with a commercial full-scale micro-CHP system, which comprises the same cells. The results show that the measured temperature dynamics of the short stack in a test stand environment are on the order of many minutes; therefore, one cannot neglect temperature dynamics for a precise measurement of the steady state polarisation behaviour. The overall polarisation performance is comparable to that of the full stack employed in the micro-CHP system, confirming the good representation that short-stack analyses can give of the entire SOFC module. The environmental performance is measured verifying the negligible values of NO emissions (&lt;10 ppb) across the whole polarisation curve.<br/> &copy; 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The development of hybrid vehicular power systems has been conducted for decades to improve transportation quality mainly in terms of environment pollution and fuel economy. Hence, hybrid electric vehicular systems are considered an attractive and potential solution in the long run to replace conventional combustion engine vehicles. In this paper, a scaled-down vehicular powertrain test bench is designed and constructed utilizing a hybrid fuel cell/battery energy sources. The performance of the proposed test bench is also investigated experimentally to explore the modes of operation for system components under various road conditions. Load-following energy management strategy is implemented experimentally in this hybrid configuration. The concepts that can be learned from such test bench are certainly essential for any future implementation on real full-size vehicles. In this study, it is shown that even though fuel cells have a good energy-to-weight ratio, they have a slow response and that is why they must be combined with other fast-response energy sources like a battery or supercapacitor. The test bench is mainly built to explore the implementation of various energy management strategies and control algorithms without the need to have a real vehicle and an automotive test track. In addition, it is an excellent platform for training highly qualified automotive engineers and university undergraduate students as well as automotive researchers. &copy; 2017, &copy; The Author(s) 2017.},

In this framework, the studies involved in system aging and lifetime prediction can be extremely time consuming and costly. Thus, introducing accelerated aging methodologies to reduce test duration and costs becomes now an open question at an international level. This article aims to raise awareness on this topic, analysing the accelerated stress test (AST) applications proposed in PEMFC domain. An overview on the main protocols reported in literature is then presented focusing on PEMFC lifetime prediction applications. The open issues related to the protocols' development and to the AST coupling with natural aging are also evaluated. Finally, new proposals are presented.

In this context cloud computing technology offers new ideas to solve such problems and has reduced the concern of large and complex testing systems. In this research in order to improve the quality and performance of web applications load testing, we proposed a method for web applications load testing based on cloud computing. The proposed method uses the existing facilities in the cloud including pool of computing resources without initial cost, unlimited data storage and cloud computing managerial procedures, containing the actual load generating and multi-user concurrency testing, that lead to improved load testing flexibility, time and operational costs. Moreover, in this load testing method, in order to manage resources and virtual machines, significant improvement is achieved by use of appropriate allocation, reducing performance and unnecessary migration avoiding methods. Through evaluation section of the proposed method through a simulated test environment, it is shown that cloud-based load testing in comparison with traditional methods of load testing, improves factors such as effort, cost and time. &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

An energy detector, which is composed by focusing lens, an integration rod, a special crystal, a filter, a photodiode and a signal processing circuit, is designed. Specially, the second-order active low-pass filter is used for narrow pulse shaping so as to reduce the difficulty of the signal processing circuit. Also, an experimental setup is designed to testing the performances of the energy detector. The results show that the relative error between the measured value and the designed value of the shaped pulse for the energy detector is about 3%, and the response time of the energy detector can meet the application of pulse energy measurement with pulse's repetition rate up to 4 kHz. Secondly, with a double-beam ratiometric method which is used to remove excimer laser pulse energy fluctuation, the performances of the energy detector are tested; the energy detector's repeatability is 0.26%; within a dynamic range of pulse energy from 0.1 &mu;J to 1 &mu;J per pulse, the linear fit is V=0.59841E-0.01508 and R<sup>2</sup>=99.976%.

Mass balance is studied and data validation and reconciliation have been carried out in 5<sup>th</sup>refinery of South Pars Gas Complex in order to achieve the reliable data of the plant. Then the possibility of capacity increase has been studied, taking into account the important parameters such as alteration of the plant pressure profile. Calculation of the key parameters for different equipment at higher feed rate, specified the unit of operations which may have trouble during the capacity enhancement. The performance of export gas compressors, dehydration unit and High-Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) has been anticipated to be the obstacle of this project according to the results of design basis review. In order to increase the feed rate the operation at constant inlet pressure is considered while the final stage pressure decreases as it is safe procedure for the plant. Then performance test has been carried out to monitor the changes in the plant. Three methodologies were designed and evaluated for implementing the performance test, and the stepwise procedure has been carried out successfully. During the performance test, the feed rate has been increased in three consecutive steps by 4.5%, 3% and 2.5% respectively. The operation of key equipment such as turbo expanders, exports and refrigerant compressors, dehydration beds, columns and filters, have been examined by taking samples from inlet-outlet streams such as feed gas, acid gas, lean and rich amine, LPG product. Following the step wised feed rate increase, the performance test was operationally successful and the production capacity of sweet gas in South Pars has been increased about 10%. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

The experimental results showed that the LED samples' lumen maintenance property might have dependence on the silicone amount in the package. In this paper, we further studied the effect of silicone amount on the lumen maintenance under HAST. Five categories of LED specimens specified by silicone amount were prepared and subjected to an isothermal chamber whose temperature was set at 125 &deg;C. An online testing system was used to monitor and record the light outputs in real time during the experimental process. After 400 hours of aging, the largest attenuating range reached 6.17% and different groups display different degradation behaviors. An exponential decay model was adopted to calculate the decay rate of each lumen maintenance curve. The decay rate differs as the silicone amount inside the package modules changes. This phenomenon is well explained and Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations are carried out to validate the explanation. The interaction effect of both silicone amount and temperature is also found and more researches need to be done for further study. &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {As a new era of &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; comes, contemporary database management systems (DBMS) introduced new functions to satisfy new requirements for big volume and velocity applications. Although the development agenda goes at full pace, the current testing agenda does not keep up, especially to validate non-functional requirements, such as: performance and scalability. The testing approaches strongly rely on the combination of unit testing tools and benchmarks. There is still a testing methodology missing, in which testers can model the runtime environment of the DBMS under test, defining the testing goals and the harness support for executing test cases. The major contribution of this paper is the MoDaST (Model-based Database Stress Testing) approach that leverages a state transition model to reproduce a runtime DBMS with dynamically shifting workload volumes and velocity. Each state in the model represents the possible running states of the DBMS. Therefore, testers can define state goals or specific state transitions that revealed bugs. Testers can also use MoDaST to pinpoint the conditions of performance loss and thrashing states. We put MoDaST to practical application testing two popular DBMS: PostgreSQL and VoltDB. The results show that MoDaST can reach portions of source code that are only possible with non-functional testing. Among the defects revealed by MoDaST, when increasing the code coverage, we highlight a defect confirmed by the developers of VoltDB as a major bug and promptly fixed. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

The influence rule of three parameters above on fertigation performance was obtained. Then through the orthogonal test with 3-factors and 3-levels, the combination of optimal structure parameters was got with CFD numerical calculation, that means, tapered angle &alpha;=20&deg;, divergent angle &beta;=8&deg; and throat diameter d<inf>0</inf>=6 mm. And the best fertigation performance was got when the angle between the absorption tube and the main pipe of Venturi was around 40&deg;. Comparing with the simulated data and actual operation data of integrated water and fertilizer fertigation machine, it indicated that the fertigation absorption flow of Venturi was increased by about 38.6% after CFD numerical optimization, and the overall fertilizer absorption flow was increased by about 47.6% with fertigation machine matched with the fuzzy automatic control system. The energy saving effect is remarkable. &copy; 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.},

abstract = {Financial networks, creating potential propagation channels for shocks in crises, are widely viewed as a key factor to systemic stability. In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of deleveraging in an overlapping network of assets. We study the deleveraging spirals driven by the interaction between fire sales and confidence effects, and show how distress is amplified and propagated throughout the network. Using the regulatory data from the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), we construct the assets overlapping network and then apply the model to the system. The result suggests that: (1) the mutually reinforcing effects of fire sales and confidence can contribute to contagion significantly; (2) The vulnerability of the system are largely dependant on the distribution of large illiquid assets. Our model provides a ready-to-use yet powerful stress testing tool for macro-prudential regulation. &copy; 2016 TCCT.},

abstract = {Feedstock composition can affect final fuel yields and quality for the fast pyrolysis and hydrotreatment upgrading pathway. However, previous studies have focused on individual unit operations rather than the integrated system. In this study, a suite of six pure lignocellulosic feedstocks (clean (no bark) pine, whole-tree (including bark) pine, tulip poplar, hybrid poplar, switchgrass, and corn stover) and two blends (equal weight percentages whole-tree pine/tulip poplar/switchgrass and whole-tree pine/clean pine/hybrid poplar) were prepared and characterized. These materials then underwent fast pyrolysis and hydrotreatment. Although some feedstocks showed a high fast pyrolysis bio-oil yield, such as tulip poplar at 60%, high yields in the hydrotreater were not always observed. Results showed overall fuel yields of 17% (switchgrass), 20% (corn stover), 24% (tulip poplar, blend 1, blend 2), 25% (whole-tree pine, hybrid poplar), and 27% (clean pine). Simulated distillation of the upgraded oils indicated that the gasoline fraction varied from 39% (clean pine) to 51% (corn stover), while the diesel fraction ranged from 40% (corn stover) to 46% (tulip poplar). Little variation was seen in the jet fuel fraction at 11-12%. Hydrogen consumption during hydrotreating, a major factor in the economic feasibility of the integrated process, ranged from 0.051 g/g dry feed (tulip poplar) to 0.070 g/g dry feed (clean pine). &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A construction project in the city of Constanze, Germany, Konstanz, on Lake Constance, provided a rare opportunity to install several test piles of different types and test these with regard to their bearing capacity. This opportunity was used to investigate full- displacement bored piles (FDP), vibro-concrete columns (VCC) and vibro-mortar columns (VMC). During pile installation, an on-line quality monitoring and verification system was used to monitor productivity. The results of this installation process were verified by static and dynamic axial load tests, with which it was hoped to show to what extent these agree with the results of the quality monitoring and the static tests and are therefore suitable for these foundation elements. The difficult foundation soil including very soft lacustrine clay presented a particularly interesting challenge. Despite the very unfavourable conditions, unexpectedly high individual loads were measured for the floating-installed columns. For the vibro-concrete column, the limit settlement was not achieved until an axial load of 1,000 kN had been reached. The full-displacement bored pile "failed" at a load of 720 kN, and the 4 m-shorter vibro-mortar column still required a load of 680 kN to reach its limit settlement. In comparison, the dynamic-loading tests confirmed the limit load-bearing capacities thus determined with a deviation of only about 5 %. However, a deviation of about 33 % from the statically determined bearing capacity of the full-displacement pile was less than satisfactory, and this remains to be investigated in detail with the results of future loading tests. &copy; The authors and ICE Publishing: All rights reserved, 2015.},

abstract = {Scope: These test methods cover the evaluation of tire performance on snow and ice surfaces utilizing passenger car or light truck vehicles. Since the tires are evaluated as part of a tire/vehicle system, the conclusions reached may not be applicable to the same tires tested on a different vehicle. These test methods do not purport to identify every maneuver useful for determining tire performance in a winter environment. These test methods are not meant to evaluate vehicle performance. Allowing for the variability of test results with different vehicles, these procedures have been developed and selected to evaluate relative tire-snow performance. These test methods are suitable for research and development purposes, where tires are compared during a single series of tests. They may not be suitable for regulatory statutes or specification acceptance because the values obtained may not necessarily agree or correlate either in rank order or absolute traction performance level with those obtained under other environmental conditions on other surfaces or the same surface after additional use. The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only.

In the proposed system, a series of analog circuits are used not only to adjust the temperature and control the bias voltage but also to monitor the current and recover the clock from the communication data. In addition, the temperature compensation and multiplication gain control algorithm are embedded in the microcontroller to improve the performance of the receiver. As shown in the experiment, with the change of communication rate from 10 to 2000 Mbps, the detection sensitivity of the APD receiver varies from -47 to -34 dBm. Moreover, due to the existence of the multiplication gain control algorithm, the dynamic range of the APD receiver is effectively improved, while the dynamic range at 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps is 38.7, 37.7, and 32.8 dB, respectively. As a result, the experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions, and the receiver will improve the flexibility of the intersatellite links without increasing the cost. &copy; 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

In recent years, significant efforts have been placed on developing nondestructive techniques such as acoustic emission to monitor and effectively assess the integrity of a structure without causing significant damage. However, acoustic emission methods face challenges regarding the subjectivity of associated performance evaluation criteria and a lack of measurable parameters directly related to the mechanical response of the system. It has been previously suggested that an integrated approach of the cyclic load testing method with acoustic emission techniques may overcome these difficulties and constitute a more effective, nondestructive load testing methodology. The current investigation analyzes experimental data gathered from flexural testing of six full-scale prestressed girder specimens (lightweight and normalweight) and presents a potential approach for damage detection and assessment within the minor to intermediate damage zones based on acoustic emission data.

The results would provide basis for normal operation while helium turbine system is successfully connected with reactor in the future.

The rotor was supposed to be arranged in an enclosed vessel and low density environment inside the vessel can be acquired. By analyzing the preliminary thermo-hydraulic characteristics of test system, turbomachinery performance under low density was achieved and temperature distribution was estimated. The results indicate that the maximum temperature of motor's stator is the temperature limit of test system.

This effort is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of gasification for contaminated carcass disposal and to identify technical challenges and improvements that will simplify, improve, and enhance the gasifier system as a mobile response tool. Past testing of the prototype demonstrated partial success, in that the transportability and rapid deployment requirements were met, however, the throughput of animal carcasses was approximately 1/3 of the intended design capacity. Significant modifications were made to various gasifier components, including the burner system, feed system, control system, power distribution, and ash handling system in order to increase its operating capacity to the rated design throughput. A series of tests were performed in September 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of the design modifications at increasing the system's throughput, as well as to demonstrate the unit's ability to operate around the clock for an extended period of time. These tests, once again, were partially successful, with the new burner system, feed system, control system, and power distribution systems all functioning in an acceptable manner. However, the ash removal system and the system to move material across the bed failed during the tests due to material issues. This paper summarizes the results of the test.},

abstract = {The Karman vortex induced vibration (KVIV) is observed over a wide range of conditions, and has been regarded as a negative phenomenon until now since it has caused many accidents. Therefore a lot of researches have been conducted to predict and to avoid it. Recently, however, KVIV is regarded as a process to convert energy of natural flows into mechanical energy, and techniques for electricity generation utilizing it are proposed. The electric power of this method is smaller than that of wind and water turbine generations, but this method has possibility to become a smaller and more maintenance-free apparatus than rotary machines. In earlier works, we found that the trailing vortex shed periodically from a cruciform two-circular-cylinder system, and that it induces a cross flow vibration on the upstream cylinder (TVIV) over a wide velocity range, which becomes broader by replacing the downstream cylinder by a strip-plate. Because of this character, an electricity generator utilizing TVIV should be effectively applied to rivers of which velocity usually varies largely. The purpose of this work is to develop a technique to generate electricity utilizing TVIV in water flow. Experiments using a water tunnel and an open-surface water channel are conducted to know conditions of the maximum electric power and to test the performance in a river. The optimum gap-to-diameter ratio is 0.22 since the cylinder vibration amplitude is largest. The optimum resistance of the circuit is the value which makes the virtual damping due to electricity generation nearly equal to the structure damping. The performance test in the water channel shows that the open surface and the turbulence in flow have little influences on the cylinder vibration amplitude and the synchronization velocity range of KVIV. However, TVIV is not observed, maybe because of the large aspect ratio. Copyright &copy; 2011 by ASME.},

A dedicated test circuit was designed and fabricated in order to meet the need for accelerated techniques for those structures. It integrated an in-house miniaturized circuit connected to additional test equipment (e.g., oscilloscopes and capacitance meters) that enabled the reliability characterization of capacitive switches. The accelerated stress test (AST) circuit generated an electrostatic-discharge-like impulse that stressed the device. This setup allowed the simultaneous measurement of the current and voltage waveforms, and the capacitance variation of the device under test after each stress. The results obtained using the miniature AST circuit were discussed and were correlated with results obtained using a commercial human-body-model tester as well as data from a cycling benchmark. The scope of this paper encompasses the theory, methodology, and practice of measurement; the development of a testing miniaturized board; and the analysis and representation of the information obtained from a set of measurements. As a result, it may contribute to the scientific and technical standards in the field of instrumentation and measurement of electrostactically actuated devices having insulating layers. &copy; 2006 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Processor stress test utilities are important tools for a number of different use cases. In particular, cooling systems need to be tested at maximum load in order to ensure that they fulfill their specifications. Additionally, a test system characterization in terms of idle and maximum power consumption is often a prerequisite for energy efficiency research. This creates the need for a simple yet versatile tool that generates near-peak power consumption of compute nodes. While in different research areas tools such as LINPACK and Prime95 are commonly used, these tools are just highly optimized and compute intense routines that solve specific computational problems. As stress test utilities they are unnecessarily hard to use and in many cases unreliable in terms of power consumption maximization. We propose FIRESTARTER, an Open Source tool that is specifically designed to create near-peak power consumption. Our experiments show that this task cannot be achieved with generic high-level language code. We therefore use highly optimized assembly routines that take the specific properties of a given processor microarchitecture into account. A study on four compute nodes with current or last generation x86-64 processors shows that we reliably exceed the power consumption of other stress tests and create very steady power consumption patterns. &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Fuel burn, or energy consumption, impacts the environment as well as the profitability of the European road transport refrigeration sector and is of significant importance. Several approaches to establish regulations in this area demonstrate that there is a lack of necessary test data. In this paper we will address the relationship between the energy efficiency and the energy consumption of the transport refrigeration unit. At present for these types of systems, the use of official ATP test data established under controlled ambient temperature according to the ATP rules (an international agreement for transport of perishable foodstuffs supported by the United Nations), can give only a partial answer regarding the energy efficiency of the marketed products. This test protocol measures the fuel burn of the refrigeration unit in steady state conditions, which are considered very close to full load data. But full load test data appears only when the refrigeration unit is pulling down the inside air temperature of the trailer or box, or during the delivery cycle, when the refrigeration unit has to cool down the ambient air that entered into the trailer body during multiple door openings. The temperature recorded in actual usage demonstrates that for most of the time, the transport refrigeration system operates in partial load to compensate only for the thermal losses of the trailer body. Based on new standards already in development in Europe, this paper will explain how partial load tests can be performed in standard calorimeter tests rooms, and will present data obtained from independent and dependent refrigeration units. The limits of the usage of this data for modeling the global energy consumption of the refrigerated truck or trailer will be highlighted.<br/>},

abstract = {The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for conceptually describing data on the Web, and SPARQL is the query language for RDF. As RDF data continue to be published across heterogeneous domains and integrated at Web-scale such as in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, RDF data management systems are being exposed to queries that are far more diverse and workloads that are far more varied. The first contribution of our work is an indepth experimental analysis that shows existing SPARQL benchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries and varied workloads. To address these shortcomings, our second contribution is the Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) that provides stress testing tools for RDF data management systems. Using WatDiv, we have been able to reveal issues with existing systems that went unnoticed in evaluations using earlier benchmarks. Specifically, our experiments with five popular RDF data management systems show that they cannot deliver good performance uniformly across workloads. For some queries, there can be as much as five orders of magnitude difference between the query execution time of the fastest and the slowest system while the fastest system on one query may unexpectedly time out on another query. By performing a detailed analysis, we pinpoint these problems to specific types of queries and workloads. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {The Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM) is sponsored by NASA&rsquo;s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) office. The goal of GPIM is to advance the technology readiness level of a green propulsion system, specifically, one using the monopropellant, AF-M315E, by demonstrating ground handling, spacecraft processing, and on-orbit operations. One of the risks identified for GPIM is potential contamination of sensitive spacecraft surfaces from the effluents in the plumes of AF-M315E thrusters. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is conducting activities to characterize the effects of AF-M315E plume impingement and deposition. GRC has established individual plume models of the 22-N and 1-N thrusters that will be used on the GPIM spacecraft. The model simulations will be correlated with plume measurement data from Laboratory and Engineering Model 22-N, AF-M315E thrusters. The thrusters are currently being tested in a small rocket, altitude facility at NASA GRC. A suite of diagnostics, including Raman spectroscopy, Rayleigh spectroscopy, and Schlieren imaging are being used to acquire plume measurements of AF-M315E thrusters. Plume data will include temperature, velocity, relative density, and species concentration. The plume measurement data will be compared to the corresponding simulations of the plume model. The GRC effort will establish a data set of AF-M315E plume measurements and a plume model that can be used for future AF-M315E applications.<br/> &copy; 2014 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The reflectors are made of heat-formed aluminum substrate of the thickness gauged of 200 m of the alloy 5052, followed by epoxy replication on Pt/C-sputtered smooth Pyrex cylindrical mandrels to acquire the X-ray reflective surface. The epoxy layer is 20 m depth. In this paper, we report a thermal stress test of the reflectors of the HXT. The reflectors can experience in various temperature environment either in ground or in space. The temperature range can be as wide as several tens degrees in space dependently on the thermal design of the telescope system. We kept the reflectors in the three different temperatures at 5, 50 and 60 degrees, respectively, for a week. It is found that the surface of the reflectors at 60 degrees or higher temperature were significantly changed. The change appears as wrinkles with a typical scale length of a few tens micron meters. It is noticed that the scale length is equivalent to the depth of the epoxy layer, suggesting the existence of the epoxy layer causes the change in the scale length. No changes on the surface were observed from the 5 and 50 degree samples. No change on X-ray reflectivity was also detected from them. &copy; 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {The digital substations are being built based on the IEC 61850 network. The cooperation and protection of power system are becoming more intelligent and reliable in the environment of digital substation. This paper proposes a novel method to prevent the malfunction caused by the Transformer Magnetizing Inrush Current(TMIC) using the IEC 61850 based data sharing between the IEDs. To protect a main transformer, the current differential protection(87T) and over-current protection(50/51) are used generally. The 87T IED applies to the second harmonic blocking method to prevent the malfunction caused by the TMIC. However, the 50/51 IED may malfunction caused by the TMIC. To solve that problem, the proposed method uses a GOOSE inter-lock signal between two IEDs. The 87T IED transmits a blocking GOOSE signal to the 50/51 IED, when the TMIC is detected. The proposed method can make a cooperation of digital substation protection system more intelligent. To verify the performance of proposed method, this paper performs the real time test using the RTDS (Real Time Digital Simulator) test-bed. Using the RTDS, the power system transients are simulated, and the TMIC is generated. The performance of proposed method is verified in real-time using that actual current signals. The reaction of simulated power system responding to the operation of IEDs can be also confirmed.<br/>},

abstract = {Real time monitoring of broadband performance parameters is critical for estimating the user experience of new broadband services like VoIP, IPTV, Gaming and Video. This information is of interest to service providers themselves for efficient network design and maintenance and government regulatory bodies for analyzing ISPs, regions and national benchmarking. A web-based system TRUEE (Tool for Real-time User Experience Estimation) is a distributed system that incorporates independent modules such as standalone measurement devices installed at customer premises, data centers, test servers and web-clients for remote monitoring and management of the system. The focus of this paper is to discuss the process of benchmarking three commercial embedded devices with PC as reference device representing an end user system for accessing broadband services. This work is part of the ongoing development process of TRUEE. This benchmarking process is of significant importance for making an informed decision on the suitability of an embedded device capable of providing desired accuracy and consistency in estimation of the broadband performance parameters. Based on literature review, online forum reviews and cost analysis three devices based on ARM viz. SheevaPlug, Texas Instrument's BeagleBoard-xM and Gumstix Overo are selected for benchmarking. Results show that Marvell's SheevaPlug outperforms the other two devices in accurately measuring the broadband parameters on its network interface. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Upon completion of a successful Distribution Automation (DA) Pilot Project centered in National Grid's upstate New York service territory, it was determined that the reliability improvements delivered by the pilot demonstration justified a much more comprehensive effort to further evaluate additional Smart Grid technologies. The vision was to conduct experiments with a full suite of Smart Grid technologies including: AMI; Home Area Network and energy management systems; Automatic Fault Isolation &amp; System Restoration; advanced feeder monitoring; distribution transformer monitoring; single pole tripping and Pulse Closing technology on distribution line reclosers; advanced capacitor control with independent pole operation; faulted circuit indicators with 2-way communication capability; and distribution fault locating capability. This vision came to be known as National Grid's Smart Grid Pilot proposal. Many challenges exist with such a comprehensive approach from public and personnel safety, to ensuring interoperability between devices and systems of different manufacture. In order to determine which technologies would provide the most benefit to National Grid's customer base, a means was needed to prequalify the various types of products available before large scale deployments were initiated. Looking at the large number of Smart Grid device suppliers, architectures and products available, we realized that the optimum solution would be to build a facility wherein a wide range of Smart Grid technologies could be installed and systematically put through their paces; i.e. actually tested in as near a real-world atmosphere as practical. Thus was born the National Grid Smart Technology Centre or STC. Soon thereafter, National Grid's Utility of the Future engineering team designed, engineered, and constructed a truly innovative test fixture that enabled system level testing on complex distribution networks to ensure process safety during field deployment. One of only a few known organizations in the U.S., National Grid has in-house capability to truly test and evaluate an end-to-end Smart distribution system architecture where systems such as automated fault isolation and system restoration can be evaluated. This paper will discuss interoperability testing that National Grid embarked upon to prepare for its proposed Smart Grid Pilot demonstration and will detail the lengths that were taken in creating a test site where medium voltage Smart Grid technologies could be fully evaluated to ensure that the various applications would play well with each other prior to actually being deployed in the field. Furthermore, this paper will focus on providing an overview of the system level testing and technical evaluation of distribution protection and control equipment with automated fault isolation and system restoration capabilities. It will also detail a number of lessons learned from this effort and discuss future plans for smart technology evaluation as a basis for an educational platform and workforce training tool. &copy; 2012 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Responding to more demand in coming years, the task of the small wind energy industry requires progress on several fronts - from public policy initiatives, to technology development, to market growth. Enhanced technologies such as contra-rotating blades, transmission systems, lubrication, airfoils, generators, and power electronics will lower cost and increase energy production. This paper mainly considers two key technological points of a small wind energy converter (SWEC) namely, the performance of the rotor system and induction generator. Small-scale prototypes have been built to experimentally verify the performance of the SWEC. Wind tunnel tests of the power output, power coefficient, and turbine speed were carried out to ascertain the aerodynamic power conversion and the operation capability at lower wind speeds. The results demonstrated a significant increase in performance compared to a single-rotor system of the same type. Another aspect of development and test is to present a comparative performance evaluation between a standard induction generator and an efficient but with modified design (TRIAS Generator) as a realistic solution of clean power for grid-connected SWECs. The paper also discusses issues related to control and monitoring of SWEC. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {The information systems are becoming more and more complex and it is very common these days where database sizes are in hundreds of GBs. Handling of such large data volumes is creating challenges for assuring the performance of end-user applications. Applications involving database transactions are worst hit as there is no clue about the time required to fetch the relevant data from the huge database. The tools available in the market and the existing methodologies are suitable for the production environment but not effective in the development environment. This creates a gap between database application development and its deployment in the production environment. Therefore assuring the performance against high volume is an indisputable problem faced by the application developer and tester. In this paper, we discuss the work done in industry to tackle the SQL performance problem arising because of large data volumes and present SQL-PASS (SQL Performance Assurance Services), a web based service developed by TCS innovation Lab - Performance engineering, which helps to validate the SQL performance against high volumes without using actual data. We will also discuss how this service has been used in the development project to assure the performance. Copyright &copy; 2011 ACM.<br/>},

abstract = {Descaling nozzles, generator of high-speed waterjets, are key components in high-pressure waterjet descaling system. Jet performance of the nozzle has great effect on hot-rolling steel billet descaling. Most domestic manufactures provide nozzle structural data and impact force scale with rated pressure, such as orifice diameter, injecting angle and scattering angle. However, jet distribution shape and jet impact force distribution and strength, which are major parameters affecting steel billet descaling quality, are not available from manufactures. A jet performance test device for nozzles was developed in this paper. Two and three dimensional graphs of jet impact force distribution with different standoff distance were obtained. Shape of jet distribution area was indicated in two dimensional graphs while jet impact strength and distribution were given in three dimensional graphs, providing evidence for jet performance judgement. Injecting angle, scattering angle and flow volume coefficient could also be measured with the device. A fan-type nozzle used for scale removal was tested. Results obtained were presented and discussed. &copy; (2011) Trans Tech Publications.},

There are a number of tools and techniques for Web application testing, but few of these have addressed the procedure to gather user session data accessed in the production environment to assist testing SOA and SOC Web application performance, so as to apply appropriate user-level quality of service policy (user-level QoS) according to the test result. In this paper, we present a session-based user behavior meta-model (SUBM) to automatically generate test cases for user-level QoS load testing. SUBM represents realistic user behavior by exploiting user session information taken from server logs. The major contribution of this paper is the fundamental role of user behavioral authenticity in load testing.

VSTM encompasses a real stress testing machine, a virtual stress-testing machine, and a server that initiates and regulates all component physics and visualization processes the server also controls the real Instron. A series of benchmark tests were conducted for analysis of reliability and to demonstrate how such tests can and should be conducted so as to foster communication between mechanical engineers and their colleagues across disciplines. These tests have demonstrated the concept of creating a physics-based virtual environment by revealing both the accuracy and real-time functionality of the simulation. The tests also exposed some system vulnerabilities in network communication and remote memory access processes.

abstract = {Simply having a large beta test cannot consistently provide stability and performance to game servers, which are major issues in online game development. Therefore, test automations have been used in order to reduce the testing time of online games by simulating highly repetitive tasks and emulating server loads. However, in previous approaches, blackbox testing and scenario-based testing are not supported because they use prerecorded packets of real players as templates, or reuse a subset of the main game client for the test client. In this paper, we propose blackbox testing and scenario-based testing of online games as well as simple load testing. Instead of rewriting the virtual client dummy code, only the game description language and virtual game map are redefined when a new game is to be tested. In addition, an actual testing environment can be mimicked more closely, because complex and various scenarios such as attack, party play, and waypoint movement can be tested through combining actions. We have applied our tools on several online games to verify the effectiveness of our method. &copy; 2010 IEEE.<br/>},

Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC (BJC) is the environmental management contractor for the DOE Oak Ridge Operations Office. The Shaw Group operates and maintains the incinerator under subcontract to BJC. The TSCAI is designed and permitted to thermally treat radioactively contaminated TSCA (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and RCRA hazardous wastes. The incinerator consists of a rotary kiln and a secondary combustion chamber followed by a wet off-gas cleaning system. The off-gas cleaning system includes a; quench chamber, venturi scrubber, packed bed scrubber, dual ionizing wet scrubbers (IWS) in series, induced draft fan, and exhaust stack. Pre-testing was conducted in December 2004, and the CPT was conducted in March 2005. The Shaw Group performed sampling, analysis, and reporting of the CPT results. Emissions were sampled and analyzed for semi-volatile metals (SVM) (Cadmium [Cd] and Lead [Pb]), low volatile metals (LVM) (Arsenic [As], Beryllium [Be], and Chromium [Cr]), Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) (1, 2, 4-trichlorobenzene [TCB] and carbon tetrachloride [CCl<inf>4</inf>]), particulate matter (PM), and total hydrocarbons (THC). Based on the results of the 2001 RCRA Trial Burn Report, a data-in-lieu-of approval was obtained for dioxins/furans, mercury, and hydrogen chloride / chlorine (HCl/Cl<inf>2</inf>). Carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen (O <inf>2</inf>), and carbon dioxide were analyzed using permanent continuous emissions monitors (CEMS), with THC analyzed using a temporary CEMS analyzer. During the test program, materials were spiked into containerized solid waste feeds and directly into the liquid waste feed lines and included TCB, CCl <inf>4</inf>, ash (titanium dioxide [TiO<inf>2</inf>]), arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead. Incinerator feed consisted of solids, organic liquids, and aqueous waste streams. All CPT performance objectives were met. In addition, a permanent continuous particulate emission monitoring system was utilized as a process indicator and tool for the real time adjustment of process conditions. Data were obtained and are presented comparing the Method 5 particulate emission results with the output from the particulate emission monitoring system.},

abstract = {In the application of corrosion prevention compounds (CPCs), two prime challenges are the lack of a means of performance evaluation and the understanding of the critical properties for the effective protection. This research attempted to investigate those key properties and their influence on CPCs' performance. One result was the development of a suite of test methods to assess performance and key properties. CPCs' performance on AA7075-T6 was assessed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Excellent protection was exhibited by CPC-coated surfaces with interfacial impedances above 0.1 Mohms-cm2 or double layer capacitances below 7.6 x 10-8 F/cm 2. In addition, a prediction method was demonstrated based on impedance parameters that showed the feasibility of using data from less than 50 days of exposure to predict the performance after 180 days of exposure. CPCs provided protection mainly through the formation and maintenance of barrier film. The failure of CPCs is mainly driven by the defects present in the film and at the film/substrate interface. The free energies for the water displacement process indicated that all CPCs could displace water from both pristine and mildly corroded surfaces. However, severely corroded surfaces were found to be more compatible with water so that CPCs cannot displace water from such surfaces. Wicking rates were determined in-situ using fiber optic sensors assembled into simulated lap joints. All tested CPCs demonstrated the ability to wick into occluded regions albeit at varied rates. The wicking rates were substantially smaller when water was present in the occluded regions. The gap of the joint had a strong effect on the wicking kinetics of water and CPCs. For vertically-oriented samples, wicking was slower in tight lap structures and increased with increasing gap to a maximum and then decreased with further increases in gap. No maximum was observed for horizontally-oriented crevices. A simulation of the wicking kinetics was presented. The simulation reproduced the trend of the changes of wicking kinetics with crevice gap that was obtained from experiment. Among the properties that were investigated through the simulation, the viscosity had the dominant effect on wicking kinetics. CPCs with smaller viscosity have faster wicking rates.

To illustrate the suitability of wireless sensors for short-term monitoring of highway bridges, a wireless monitoring system is installed upon the Grove Street Bridge to monitor structural responses during static and dynamic load testing. Specifically, load testing of the Grove Street Bridge is conducted after its construction to validate the behavior of a novel jointless bridge deck constructed from a high-performance fiber reinforced cementations composite (HPFRCC) material. A heterogeneous array of sensing transducers are installed in the bridge including metal foil strain gages, accelerometers and linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs). First, the acceleration response of the bridge is monitored by the wireless system during routine traffic loading. Modal parameters (modal frequencies and mode shapes) are calculated by the wireless sensors so that an analytical model of the bridge constructed in a standard commercial finite element package can be updated off-line. Next, the bridge is closed to traffic and trucks of known weight are parked on the bridge to induce static deformations. The installation strategy of the wireless monitoring system during static load testing is optimized to monitor the strain and rotation response of the HPFRCC deck. The measured static response of the deck is compared to that predicted by the updated analytical model.},

This was attributed to the absence of transverse stiffeners at the extreme ends of the girders. However, none of the bridge girders showed any signs of distress. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation recently conducted a field study to investigate this shear issue in greater detail. To that end, a test program was devised to (a) monitor the real stresses in the end panels of two selected girders in the Hogg's Hollow Bridge when subjected to (i) a test truck with known axle loads and (&laquo;) normal highway traffic loading, and (b) calibrate the observed stresses against theoretically expected responses in the girders and calculate the live load capacity factor using the shear data derived from the field measurements.<br/>},

High-temperature burn-in and extreme-voltage stress tests are two current industrial standard methods to speed up the deterioration of electronic devices and weed-out infant mortality. Extreme-voltage stress test aims at enhancing both quality and reliability without performance the high-cost burn-in test process. Our recent stress tests of analog/mixed-signal CMOS ICs for gate-oxide reliability enhance. This paper presents a control flow model for analog CMOS circuits and uses it to develop a circuit partition scheme. A practically large analog circuit can be partitioned into many smaller sub-circuits so that the developed stress vector generator and stressability analyzer can conformably handle in term of computational complexity. In addition, a structure-based stress vector generation process is also developed. Stress vectors are generated based on the circuit topological structure without performing circuit simulations. The performance improvement proposed in this study can significantly reduce the computational complexity so that the developed stress test system can handle practically large analog CMOS circuits.},

High-performance bridges with HPC and large-diameter prestressed strands are becoming attractive to designers. Bridge A6130 is the first fully HPC superstructure bridge in Missouri. The bridge has HPC cast-in-place deck and high-strength concrete girders reinforced with 15.2-mm (0.6-in.) diameter strands. The bridge was instrumented with embedded strain gauges and thermocouples to monitor the early-age and later-age behavior of the structures from construction through service. To investigate the overall behavior of the bridge under live load, a static live-load test was developed and carried out. During the live-load test, 64 embedded vibrating wire strain gauges and 14 embedded electrical-resistance strain gauges were used to acquire the changing strain rate in the bridge caused by the varying live-load conditions. Girder deflections and rotations were also recorded with external sensors and a data acquisition system. Based on the test results, the load distribution to the girders was studied. The AASHTO specifications live-load distribution factor recommended for design was compared with the measured value and found to be overly conservative. The AASHTO load and resistance factor design live-load distribution factors recommended for design were found to be comparable to measured values. Two finite element models were developed with ANSYS and compared with measured values to investigate the continuity level of the Missouri Department of Transportation interior bent detail.},

The disturbances to the 161kV bus of the Tong-Shiao Generation Station are caused by the fluctuating reactive power from nearby electric arc furnaces. This also demonstrates the low frequency active power oscillations of generators. It is required that the generators provide enough damping to suppress active power oscillations, in addition to having a fast reactive power response. A field test method with a small step-changing signal was used to reveal the dynamic performance indexes of the generators with static excitation systems at no-load and full-load. Computer time domain simulations and eigenvalue analysis are also employed to explore the effects of loop-gains. The results show that when the loop-gain of an excitation system is higher, there is faster response of reactive power to improve voltage flicker, but also1 more serious low frequency oscillations of active power. Hence, installing a power system stabilizer is evaluated to improve the damping of the electromechanical mode (local mode). This arrangement not only lets the generator acquire damping of active power oscillations but also gives a fast reactive power response to improve voltage flicker.},

In vitro pollutant testing was devised to simulate contaminant loadings that impact urban retention ponds.

Total antioxidant activity increased with increasing pollutant loading suggesting that the organism has the capacity to enhance antioxidant defence in response to pollutant stress. This in vitro test provides a new approach to monitor the effects of water quality on the biological components of urban and/or polluted aquatic ecosystems.

Meanwhile experiments were carried out for testing the performance of this cooling gas generator. The experimental results show that this equipment may supply -26&deg;C cold gas to the cutting zone, and possesses high refrigeration speed, adjustment capacity, credibility and control abilities of the temperature of cold gas, and hence has a broad application foreground.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new product, the SonicForce&trade; Acoustic Strain Gauge (ASG), that utilizes a non-contact ultrasonic technology to measure applied strain requiring no paint removal and minimal surface preparation. After an overview of the ultrasonic technology is presented the results of a diagnostic test utilizing a prototype of the ASG will be discussed. The purpose of this test was to validate the Acoustic Strain Gauge as being functionally equivalent to the resistance strain gauge, and to demonstrate a cost effective enabling technology to the civil and structural engineering communities. The diagnostic tests program was supervised by Dr. Abba Lichtenstein in accordance with accepted guidelines contained in the manual for "Rating Bridges Through Testing" For the purpose of this study the bridge superstructure was modeled and structural loading profiles were determined using both resistive and acoustic strain measurement techniques. Measured strains as determined by the ASG (correlation between the ASG and the resistance strain gauge was 0.998) were compared to theoretical loads in order to determine if the Rodeo Gulch superstructure was operating in a safe and reliable manner. Additionally, under the direction of Phil Fish (Wisconsin DOT), two pre-production ASGs were used to monitor accumulated cyclic loading. These test data presented as a time series strip chart and rainflow histogram. &copy;2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.<br/>},

The load test enables the determination of the value of load power, current and power factor of the induction motor.

The objective of this paper is to propose a load test method using two pulleys for changing speed of an induction motor. The second induction machine is controlled to operate as an induction generator in order to transfer the energy to the supply, therefore the power required during the test is obviously reduced. The study of how to control the induction motor operated as generator will be the useful information for developing the induction generator system (IG) to work with variable speed and load, and to make it work as a stand alone generator. &copy; 2000 Int.

abstract = {Although hard-defects may be detectable in factory tests, weak products may exhibit failures or degrade only under certain stress conditions. Without stress testing, these weak products may often be shipped to customers causing early failures in the field. A candidate product for stress testing needs to get more business benefits to more than pay off the cost of stress testing. A business measure of the success of the stress testing program is the net benefit, which is the total benefit minus the total cost of the program. The optimum stress testing program maximizes this net benefit. A given unit of a product has a probability of encountering a maximum stress X during its product life. It also has a probability of possessing a product yield strength Y, which is the maximum stress the unit can survive without failure. While the strength distribution depends on the design and manufacture processes, the distribution of the maximum stress is determined by the customers' environment. A convenient picture is to construct the contour map of the joint probability distribution of X and Y. In this contour map, a unit falling in the Y &lt; X region will fail during its product life, whereas one falling in the Y &gt; X region will not result in field failure. The effects of stress testing at a given maximum stress level, X<sup>ST</sup>, are shown by a dividing line on the product strength into stress test failure and stress test pass. The units in the contour map are then divided into four regions by the Y = X line and the X<sup>ST</sup> line. The cost and benefits may now be evaluated for each region. Now the value of X<sup>ST</sup> is a free parameter that determines the relative size of each region. The second free parameter is the fraction of units going through stress testing. These two parameters may be adjusted to maximize the net benefit of the stress testing program.},

abstract = {Accurate interpretation of performance-test results can lead to improved unit heat-rate and reduced equipment failure or damage when appropriate and timely corrective actions are taken. Aware of the difficulties inherent in performance testing as well as the need for a PC-based tool to support performance engineers in power plant problem diagnosis, NYSEG and ENCOR commenced developing (in 1990) the Computerized Performance Test Program (CPTP). CPTP is designed to ease performance testing, enhance the quality of performance-test results and provide correct diagnostics and recommendations for actions to the performance-test engineer and power-operations management. To accomplish these goals, CPTP utilizes expert algorithms based on the years of experience accumulated by the engineering staffs at NYSEG and ENCOR. Such experience is demonstrated by the extensive guidance provided by CPTP regarding the prioritization of equipment testing and the preparation and execution of the proper test procedures. Equally insightful are the interpretation of the test results and the corrective actions prescribed to solve diagnosed problems. For all these reasons, CPTP is an effective training tool for plant personnel to improve the performance of the condenser and feedwater heaters and plan the maintenance of any power plant. Currently, NYSEG and Portland General Electric (PGE) are using CPTP modules for performance testing, diagnostic and training purposes.},

BIST, scan, and boundary scan can provide a framework to accomplish performance testing in a cost effective manner. It has been shown that traditional BIST, scan, and boundary scan techniques do not provide the framework for performance testing. Special BIST and scan design techniques that can be employed to guarantee high coverage of delay faults are described. Typically, these techniques produce BIST test pattern generators and scan chain designs that require sightly increased hardware overhead over conventional BIST/scan. However, they can drastically decrease the complexity of bare die performance testing. Furthermore, when used in combination with the proposed enhanced boundary scan design, they provide a framework for detection and diagnosis of dynamic failures.},
