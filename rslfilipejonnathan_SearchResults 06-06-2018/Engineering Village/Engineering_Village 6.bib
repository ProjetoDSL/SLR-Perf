abstract = {The fresh market apple industry currently relies on manual labor for all harvesting activities. The lack of mechanical harvesting technologies is a serious concern because of rising labor costs and increasingly uncertain labor availability. Researchers have been working for several decades to develop mechanical harvesters for tree fruit. The two fruit removal methods considered include mass mechanical harvesters and selective harvesting with robotics technology. Whereas mass mechanical harvesters have demonstrated unacceptable damage rates, robotic systems have been limited by insufficient speed and robustness. This paper describes the design and analysis of a novel underactuated end-effector fabricated for the robotic harvesting of tree fruit. The device has been optimized around a set of target tasks, the most critical being speed, low complexity, suitability for a highly variable field environment, and the replication of hand picking so as to minimize fruit damage. Development of the end-effector has been facilitated by a thorough study of the dynamic forces involved during the manual harvesting of apples. The end-effector produces a spherical power grasp with a normal force distribution and picking sequence replicating selected human patterns. An underactuated, tendon-driven device with compliant flexure joints has been adopted to improve system performance in the presence of position errors as well as enhance robustness to variable fruit size, shape, and orientation. The prototype end-effector also uses minimal sensors and incorporates open-loop control to reduce complexity and improve picking speed. This paper presents the theoretical analysis of the end-effector kinematics and discusses the selection of key geometric parameters. Experiments have been conducted to determine the normal forces developed during grasping of the apple. Results indicate that open-loop, feedforward control can be used to produce optimal normal force patterns. Copyright &copy; 2015 by ASME.},

abstract = {Link-time optimization (LTO) is an increasingly important and adopted modern optimization technology. It is currently supported by many production compilers, including GCC, LLVM, and Microsoft Visual C/C++. Despite its complexity, but because it is more recent, LTO is relatively less tested compared to the more mature, traditional optimizations. To evaluate and help improve the quality of LTO, we present the first extensive effort to stress-test the LTO components of GCC and LLVM, the two most widely-used production C compilers. In 11 months, we have discovered and reported 37 bugs (12 in GCC; 25 in LLVM). Developers have confirmed 21 of our bugs, and fixed 11 of them. Our core technique is differential testing and realized in the tool Proteus. We leverage existing compiler testing tools (Csmith and Orion) to generate single-file test programs and address two important challenges specific for LTO testing. First, to thoroughly exercise LTO, Proteus automatically transforms a single-file program into multiple compilation units and stochastically assigns each an optimization level. Second, for effective bug reporting, we develop a practical mechanism to reduce LTO bugs involving multiple files. Our results clearly demonstrate Proteus's utility; we plan to make ours a continuous effort in validating link-time optimizers. &copy; 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {Rubber damping pad under ballastless slab track can isolate structure vibration and noise so as to reduce stress and wear of railway track components. In order to make scientific evaluation on the influence of rubber damping pad on the dynamic response of the track structure, focusing on the engineering practice of Chengdu-GuanDujiangyan high-speed railway, comparative test of slab track with and without rubber damping pad is carried out by using acceleration sensors, acoustic sensors, and dynamic data acquisition system. Spectrum analysis of vibration acceleration and noise test results shows that rubber damping pad under track slab can greatly isolate the substructure vibration of the track, the bridge vibration and ground vibration; vibration level of the base slab under the pad is reduced by about 20.1dB; the rubber damping pad can reduce some of the structure noise caused by the bridge structure vibration, but it has no significant effect on noise reduction of the whole system due to the influences of EMU pantograph's arc noise, severe air turbulence noise and field test environment.

abstract = {This paper presents the load-settlement response of a surface footing placed over buried flexible pipe through model plate load tests. Experiments are conducted in a rectangular box after placing a model footing on the surface of sand placed at two different relative densities. Combination of tests were performed, such as, (1) model footing placed over sand compacted at low relative density (RD = 50%) and model buried flexible pipe (PVC pipe) placed at 0.5 B and 1.0 B depth, and (2) model footing placed over sand compacted at high relative density (RD = 88%) and model buried flexible pipe (PVC pipe) placed at 0.5 B &amp; 1.0 B depth; where B = diameter of the model footing. The results of the model plate load test provide useful interpretation about the combined behavior of buried flexible pipe-soil system in terms of load-settlement response. The influence on the bearing capacity of sand in different relative densities and that caused by the presence of a buried flexible pipe beneath the footing is also discussed. Experimental results are also verified numerically using the two-dimensional finite-element tool PLAXIS, and results are discussed in light of the experimental findings. Furthermore, a soil nailing technique is also explored experimentally and numerically to establish its usefulness in terms of improving the bearing capacity of the buried flexible pipe soil system in a given sand medium. &copy; 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {New versions of existing large-scale web services such as Passport.com&copy;have to go through rigorous performance evaluations in order to ensure a high degree of availability. Performance testing (such as benchmarking, scalability, and capacity tests) of large-scale stateful systems in managed test environments has many different challenges, mainly related to the reproducibility of production conditions in live data centers. One of these challenges is creating a dataset in a test environment that mimics the actual dataset in production. Other challenges involve the characterization of load patterns in production based on log analysis and proper load simulation via reutilization of data from the existing dataset. The intent of this paper is to describe practical approaches to address some of the aforementioned challenges through the use of various novel techniques. For example, this paper discusses data sanitization, which is the alteration of large dataseis in a controlled manner to obfuscate sensitive information, preserving data integrity, relationships, and data equivalence classes. This paper also provides techniques for load pattern characterization via the application of Markov Chains to custom and generic logs, as well as general guidelines for the development of cache-based load simulation tools tailored for the performance evaluation of stateful systems. &copy; 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The October 12, 2005 HWC MACT Phase II provisions for liquid-fuel fired boilers (LFBs, inclusive of process heaters) considerably altered the regulatory framework for performance testing and establishing final operating limits as compared to the RCRA boiler and industrial furnace (BIF) standards, especially as they apply to compliance with metals and HCl/Cl<inf>2</inf> emission standards. Additionally, the HWC MACT rule introduces a fundamentally different approach compared to RCRA for establishing operating limits by prescribing specific types of limits within the body of the rule based on the individual features of the combustor system and emissions control devices. Previously, the RCRA BIF delineated only a few specific limits leaving the bases for establishment of those and most of the other operating limits via related guidance and unit/site-specific considerations. Due to the prescriptive aspect of the HWC MACT provisions, personnel involved in test planning activities are faced with a more arduous task in evaluating the various compliance scenarios and options available to them, and then making very important and often immutable compliance decisions in an informed manner. This paper focuses on key aspects of the HWC MACT Phase II provisions that impact the initial evaluation of compliance, performance testing and subsequent ongoing compliance for LFBs. Topics include: Comparison of thermal concentration approach versus the mass concentration approach to metals and HCl/Cl<inf>2</inf> emissions compliance Identification of prescribed operating limits, and options that exist within the rule Delineation of a general test strategy for demonstrating the three most critical operating limits, and Opportunities to utilize the broadly applicable alternative monitoring provisions in 63.1209(g) to substitute more appropriate, unit-specific methods of compliance demonstration to those prescribed by the HWC MACT rule. Time sensitive and interrelated aspects of these issues and decisions are addressed. How these decisions could impact the methodology for complying with future operating limits is also examined. A number of example cases are provided to help illustrate the benefits of making informed, strategic decisions early on in the HWC MACT compliance process.},

The zinc content was determined by a combined scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis (SEM/EDS) of an isolated pigment fraction. The surface failures such as blistering, rusting, and other imperfections were measured for scribe creepage at 500-hour laboratory test intervals. It was found that two-coat zinc rich primer/ fast-dry topcoat systems exhibited no rust creepage and scribe after the 500-hour accelerated laboratory test and the two-year outdoor exposure in salt-rich environment.

abstract = {During the development of a new medical imaging system, via quality was identified as a potentially source of infantile failures. Premature via failures were precipitated in a critical 14 layer board, specifically in the 0.8 mm BGA vias with an aspect ratio of approximately 9:1. Failure analysis indicated two dominant failure mechanisms: dry film lock-in, and drill debris in the via barrel causing insufficient plating of the via sidewall. Dry-film lock-in was corrected by process control improvements at the fab supplier. The fab material was identified as a major driver in the presence of drill debris in the via barrel. To address these infant mortality issues and to demonstrate long term via reliability, IST testing was identified as an industry recognized tool to quickly assess fab reliability. Three parameters were identified as key variables in fine-pitch via quality and reliability: fab resin material, inclusion of non-functional pads (NFP), and type of drill machine at the fab supplier. A DOE was developed to understand the influence of these factors on overall via reliability. The following conclusions were observed. The lower CTE fab material outperformed the other fab materials in mean cycles to failure (CTF). In addition, an interesting result with NFPs was found. Contradictory to industry recommendations, the presence of NFPs actually improved the mean CTF for the same material and process. The drill machine had little to no influence on CTF for the same material and design. In addition, at the lead-free preconditioning temperature, separation of the glass fiber bundles was observed in most of the materials tested. An understanding of this phenomenon and the other failure modes is critical to developing a robust lead-free fab.<br/>},

abstract = {The problem of optimizing accelerated production testing is a pressing one in most electronic manufacturing facilities. Yet, practical models are scarce in the literature, especially for testing high volumes of electronic circuit packs in failure-accelerating environments. In this paper, we develop both a log-linear and linear model, based initially on the Weibull distribution. The models developed are suitable for modeling accelerated production testing data from a temperature-cycled environment. The model is "piecewise" in that the failures in each discrete "piece" of the temperature cycle are modeled as if the testing was in parallel rather than sequential mode. An extra covariate is introduced to indicate age at the start of each piece. The failures in a piece then depend on the stress in the piece itself and the time elapsed to the start of the piece. This last dependence captures the influence of reliability growth and has the result of providing an alternative linear model to the log-linear one. The paper demonstrates a simpler use of Poisson regression. An application, using actual production data, is described. Uses of the Loglogistic, Logistic, Lognormal and Normal distributions are also illustrated. &copy; 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.<br/>},

abstract = {The performance of multi-layer insulation (MLI) is commonly tested with a flat circular double sided hot plate calorimeter with a temperature limitation of +100&deg;C maximum. The BepiColombo mission demands insulation performance at considerably higher temperatures (up to +450&deg;C), which requires different test set-ups and facilities to obtain thermal performance data on ideal flat blankets as an extrapolation of test data obtained from the standard calorimeter would not be suitable for this extended temperature range. Real MLI has disturbances causing a loss of MLI performance due to edge effects, overlapping areas, slits and cut-outs, attachments or simply due to bending to follow the 3-dimensional (3D) shape of a spacecraft. To account for the elevated temperatures and losses due to real MLI shapes different calorimetric test setups were developed to produce performance data, which support the system thermal analysis for the spacecraft. Both ideal flat circular and 3D cubic-box MLI samples of varying sizes with the two BepiColombo HT-MLI compositions have been tested at elevated temperatures for this purpose. Thermocouples have been placed at various locations within the MLI packages to determine temperature gradients over and through the blankets. This paper describes the tested MLI compositions, the test setups used and correlates the performance and test results of 2D- and 3D- MLI samples for both compositions. The increase in the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) between ideal 2D blankets and box-shaped 3D blankets of different sizes is discussed. It is shown that the measured performance data for both MLI types are well within the design requirements set for the system analyses. The calorimetric tests prove that MLI insulation was developed which can cope with the severe thermal environment of the BepiColombo mission. &copy; 2010 by RUAG Space GmbH.},

Testing was performed at the Electrotek Electric Vehicle Test Facility (EVTF) as part of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)/Electrotek EV Program. This extended-range EV (XREV) is based on the electric G Van, which is a GMC full-sized van converted to electric propulsion by Conceptor Industries of Newmarket (Toronto), Ontario. A 7-kW Onan gasoline engine/generator (E/G) set was retrofitted into the vehicle by McKee Engineering of Lake Zurich, Illinois. The XREV utilizes tubular-plate lead-acid batteries and dc powertrain components furnished by Chloride EV Systems of Redditch, England. Testing was conducted according to the EPRI/Electrotek EV Test Plan and included measurement of driving range on the SAE J227a C Cycle, on the Electrotek-defined Chattanooga City Cycle (CCC), and at four constant speeds from 56 km/h to 80 km/h. The C Cycle and CCC tests were performed with the E/G switched on at different battery states of charge (SOC) from 100% to 25% to determine the effects of the E/G on driving range and battery behavior. Limp-home tests were also conducted over these cycles by driving the XREV on pure-electric power to 0% SOC, turning on the E/G for a one-hour battery charge, and then continuing the cycle under both battery and E/G power. It was found that use of the E/G increased driving range significantly for all cases. Additional tests were performed to determine the dc energy consumption of the XREV over the C cycle and at various constant speeds. Data is presented which includes driving test results as well as calculated costs for different combinations of electric and gasoline operation. &copy; Copyright 1992 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.<br/>},

abstract = {In order to compete in the market, companies have to produce the right products with a shorter time to market and at lower costs than before. Shorter time to market requires the product development process (PDP) to change the way of working from the classical `wait and react' to anticipating and preventing problems as early as possible in the development process. This requires a new, and different role for the quality and reliability tests used. While in a classical PDP products could be tested when available from (pilot) production, a modern, time-driven development process requires optimization long before larger series of products are available. Accelerated stress testing (AST) is a classical solution for the implementation of tests where product failures need to be activated faster (and cheaper) in a well-controlled environment at the early stage of the PDP. This paper reviews the classical AST strategy and some most recent AST strategies. It demonstrates that these accelerated test strategies are mainly based on generic lists of failure mechanisms and have only very limited relation with the actual failure rate curve of products. The theoretical background of the four-phase roller coaster failure rate curve is addressed and from this an alternative AST strategy is developed based on the relevant phases of the roller coaster curve using a concept called stressor-susceptibility analysis. A discussion, on the application of the proposed AST strategies and their impacts on the four-phase roller-coaster curves, is given at the end.},

This test stand uses large load, high bandwidth, hydraulic actuation to generate load profiles under force control. The test stand can accommodate EMA's up to six feet in length. It can generate dynamic loads of up to 100,000 lb at fundamental frequencies of up to 12 Hz against a stiff environment. This test stand has been used to generate severe loading conditions on a large roller screw in an attempt qualify the effects of large, high frequency loads on roller screw. During the tests performed in the EMA Laboratory the screw was fixed at one end and axial loads were applied to the roller nut at the other end. Since the end opposite the nut was fixed, only a small amount of relative rotation between the nut and screw was achieved. This rotation was the result of elastic deformation (wind up) of the screw along the length between the fixed end and the nut. This simulates a severe, but likely, application of the roller screw. The results of the tests performed demonstrate that roller screws may be damaged by dynamic loading with load magnitudes that are well within the static load rating of the screw. While the damage that was observed is not catastrophic, it would be expected to substantially decrease the life of the screw.},

Cyclists can choose between speed and labour-saving by moving shift levers to complete a series of mechanical motions that change gears. Therefore, the shifting performance of the derailleur system is very important in designing derailleur system components. This paper proposes a systematic procedure for arranging the design steps for the derailleur system. It promises that the derailleur system components will integrate well and operate effectively. The performance test indices in the present paper can be used to judge the shifting performance during the period of shifting gears. Many design and manufacturing imperfections in products can also be found using the experimental results from performance test. Experimental procedures provide an environment that replaces subjective human `feel' tests used in the past.},

This will increase the mean time between failure (MTBF) for these vehicles, improving uptime during mine operation and reducing failure costs for its users. This procedure can be used to identify inadequate bearing support structure, validate any required redesigns, and provide insights to optimize the life of the bearing in the measured load conditions. This paper provides results from the first testing of bearing loads in trucks using an instrumented bearing and a Torrington Co. patented data analysis algorithm. The instrumented bearing and data analysis algorithm form a valuable tool for determining applied loads in-situ, and can be utilized on any equipment or processes where bearing loads need to be measured. In fact, this technology could help users gain insight into the operating conditions in many kinds of rotating equipment by using the bearing as a transducer to measure critical system operating parameters.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the CLOS metaobject protocol approach to defining and implementing an object model is very powerful. CLOS is an object-oriented language that is based on Common Lisp and is in the process of being standardized. Implementations of CLOS are themselves object-oriented with all major building blocks of the language being instances of system classes. A metaobject protocol provides a framework for CLOS implementations by specifying the hierarchy of these classes and the order and contents of the communication among their instances. This design has made CLOS both flexible and portable, two design goals that traditionally conflict. In support of this suggestion we present a detailed account of how we added object persistence to CLOS without modifying any of the language's implementation code. &copy; 1990 ACM.},

abstract = {Scope: These test methods cover the evaluation of tire performance on snow and ice surfaces utilizing passenger car or light truck vehicles. Since the tires are evaluated as part of a tire/vehicle system, the conclusions reached may not be applicable to the same tires tested on a different vehicle. These test methods do not purport to identify every maneuver useful for determining tire performance in a winter environment. These test methods are not meant to evaluate vehicle performance. Allowing for the variability of test results with different vehicles, these procedures have been developed and selected to evaluate relative tire-snow performance. These test methods are suitable for research and development purposes, where tires are compared during a single series of tests. They may not be suitable for regulatory statutes or specification acceptance because the values obtained may not necessarily agree or correlate either in rank order or absolute traction performance level with those obtained under other environmental conditions on other surfaces or the same surface after additional use. The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only. This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

The construction of the HTTR almost ended in 1996, and the pre-operation and the commissioning tests had been carried out from 1996 till 1998 before fuel was loaded in the core. Divided into four steps depending on the hazards and interfaces involved, the pre-operation and the commissioning tests were performed.

The Liquid Nitrogen cooled "Brutus" chamber at Ball Aerospace was the test facility. Flight-like self cooling, thermal blanketing, and auxiliary cooling loops allowed the assembly to reach temperatures close to orbital conditions. (25-5 K) Introducing optical sources at the SIRTF focal plane allowed the telescope to perform as the collimating source. A motorized and cryogenically characterized reflection flat was used to direct the refocused images of test sources to visible and IR focal planes in SIRTF's Multi-Instrument Chamber. A sequence of tests was performed to gather data on system focus position, image stability, telescope wavefront and instrument assembly confocality.},

The variance in a pre-specified sampling period during the stable cutting conditions is estimated. The statistical quality control concept is then applied to set up the upper control limit. By comparing the sample variance of the coming filtered acceleration data with this value as cutting test proceeds, the onset of chatter is detected. It is found that this approach is objective and reliable. It can be employed for the performance test of other type of machine tools. The method also has a great potential in the application of machine tool chatter control.},

The limitations of single-stage high-order designs are analyzed as a compatibility problem between the linear filtering and non-linear quantizer requirements. The complexity versus performance-improvements of other strategies are also discussed. In addition to the new approach to component-compatibility analysis, the paper proposes a more rigorous analyses of the system performance by using, for the first time, groups of harmonic-rich test signals. Based on this new approach and the extensive analysis of how jointly and severally the linear and non-linear parameters influence the modulator's performance, a new design strategy is proposed and results demonstrated on a single-stage second-order modulator. The results are compared with those of an already-published second-order design for low over-sampling ratio of 64. It is shown that under the same conditions the new modulator exhibits a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio `response' over a wide dynamic range of input signals. Finally, the conclusion discusses how this approach can be extended to other designs as well as used as a framework to completely new adaptive strategies.},

Consistent test results were achieved which showed that the unit performed better than expected. Earlier calorimetric analysis had indicated that the unit was not generating the expected electrical output. These earlier results were based on final feedwater flow measurement using permanently-installed station venturis. The ASME tests, which employed calibrated ASME throat-tap nozzles to measure feedwater flow, showed that the permanently-installed venturis had been indicating high, thereby causing the unit to be operated at less than 100 percent thermal power prior to the ASME test. The causes of this discrepancy are discussed. This paper includes a description of the test program and testing procedures and the performance of the major components of the heat cycle.},
