abstract={In the past decade, NAND Flash has stood out from numerous non-volatile storage mediums. The NAND Flash based Solid State Disk (SSD) has been widely used in many storing required fields such as embedded applications and data center. A new and efficient SSD black-box performance test method is revising in this paper. The designed test system contains time parameter getter, excitation signal generator, buffer unit, write/read controller and SSD. With the application of the proposed method, not only the influence of TRIM mechanism could been analyzed, but also the test precision is increased significantly. To verify the validity and performance of our test system, the IOPS, response time and write/read bandwidth of the universal testing software (IOMETER, HDTUNE, etc.) and SATA protocol analyzer are presented and compared with our method in detail.},

abstract={Service applications are applicable to provide services for requests of users from network. Due to the fact that they have to endure a big number of concurrent requests, the performance of service applications running under specific arrival rate of requests should be assessed. To measure the performance of a service application, multi-party testing context is needed to simulate a number of concurrent requests and collect the responses. TTCN-3 is a test description language; it provides basic language elements for multi-party testing context that can be used in performance tests. This paper proposes a general approach of using TTCN-3 in multi-party performance testing service application. To this aim, a model of service application is presented, and performance testing framework for service applications is discussed. This testing framework is realized for a typical application by developing a reusable TTCN-3 abstract test suite.},

abstract={The purpose of locomotive load test is to examine and adjust the capability of locomotive often in its non-driving state, and it is a kind of important standard and means to estimate the quality of repairing locomotive in railway locomotive depot. There are two ways of load test at present. One is the water-resistor load test, the other is the dry resistor load test. Because the dry resistor-load test means does not pollute the environment and needs area less, its developing foreground is immense. To solve the difficulty that the current cannot be freely regulated continuously, for the first time, the model of weightier resistor network in digital circuit is applied to the locomotive dry resistor-load test system, which solves the problem of dry resistor-load test theoretically. It is proved by theory and test that the precision of dry resistor means can meet the request of locomotives constant power load test and reach the standard of water-resistor, so it can serve the application of the dry resistor-load test system. During the locomotive load test, the load of locomotive may be regulated so that the locomotive can be adapted run on all kinds of actual work state. According to the characteristic of weightier resistor, the control arithmetic, which is made up of fuzzy algorithm and binary algorithm, realizes the fast and exact regulation on locomotive load. This paper introduces how to apply fuzzy and binary algorithm to regulate the dry resistor-load and explains the realization of the fuzzy and binary algorithm.},

To accomplish this task, the signal is digitized at element level or at sub-array level and processed with the help of advanced digital signal processor. Proving the capabilities of this firmware at bench level helps to reduce the overall development time. Hence, it is necessary to have a built-in test unit or test vector generator to verify the optimal performance of digital modules. The best way to accomplish this goal is to use a high speed baseband I & Q radar data generator which helps in testing, identifying and segregating the problems at various stages.

abstract={In this work, a compact-type megasonic cleaning system for semiconductor manufacturing was developed and its performance was verified. To design this megasonic system, firstly, an impedance analysis for a quartz megasonic waveguide with the piezoelectric actuator was performed with finite element method (FEM) software ANSYS. The obtained peak value of the anti-resonance frequency was 983 kHz, which showed good agreement with the design value of 982 kHz. In addition, acoustic pressures of the developed system was assessed by measuring acoustic pressures and comparing standard deviation values of them with a conventional megasonic system to evaluate the system performance. The analysis results showed that the standard deviation of the developed system was decreased by 38% compared to the commercial system. For another evaluation, the particle removal efficiency (PRE) test was performed with 80 nm particles. The experimental result revealed that the system has PRE of 91%. Based on the results, the developed megasonic system is regarded as an improved cleaning system which can irradiate more uniform acoustic pressures. As a consequence, it is thought to have higher energy efficiency and save the consumption of chemical and ultra pure water (UPW) in nano-particle cleaning.},

abstract={Performance analysts rely heavily on load testing to measure the performance of their applications under a given load. During the load test, analyst strictly monitor and record thousands of performance counters to measure the run time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, network traffic etc. The most frustrating problem faced by analysts is the time spent and complexity involved in analysing these huge counter logs and finding relevant information distributed across thousands of counters. We present our methodology to help analysts by automatically identifying important performance counters for load test and comparing them across tests to find performance gain/loss. Further, our methodology help analysts to understand the root cause of a load test failure by finding previously solved problems in test repositories. A case study on load test data of a large enterprise application shows that our methodology can effectively guide performance analysts to identify and compare top performance counters across tests in limited time thereby archiving 88% counter data reduction.},

Array of SiPMs with a minimum gap between the sensors is needed for some applications where a fine imaging of sources with low intensity radiations is required.

In the first process of the fabrication, we have produced various sizes of single SiPM sensors and also the arrays. The design includes unit sensors in the size of 0.5mm × 0.5mm, consisting of 103 micropixles with the maximum geometric efficiency of 70%. One of the arrays produced is 8 × 8 matrix of the unit sensors with the sensors gap of 60 um. We have tested the sensor arrays for the electrical characteristics and the dark rates.

abstract={In recent years, Model calibration and parameter estimation with high complexity is a common problem in many areas of researches, especially in environmental modeling. This paper proposes a comparatively simple technique on the parallel implement of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). The transformation of the sequential objective evaluation in the MOPSO is based on the Matlab parallel computing tool box. Two study cases of different complexity demonstrate that the parallel implementation resulted in a considerable time saving. The deviation of computational time indicates that MOPSO has the characteristic of randomness because of the crowding distance and the dominant ranking. The proposed parallel MOPSO therefore, provides an ideal means to solve global optimization problems that are comparatively with high complexity.},

IPv6 is more and more emphasized and moving from the pilot phase to the practical application. In the process of deploying IPv6, performance is one of the key issues to be considered. Test is an effective method to understand IPv6 network performance. We need scalable and available tools to measure IPv6 network performance, but the few existing network performance test software support IPv6. So through the introduction of multi-agent technology, a distributed IPv6 network performance test model integrated with centralized control is proposed. We describe architecture and workflow of the model thoroughly, and a IPv6 network performance test system is designed and implemented based on the model. Finally, using our system, we measure IPv6 performance metrics on CERNET2 which is the largest pure IPv6 network in the world presently. The final experiments show that it is necessary to implement a IPv6 network performance test system and that our system is scalable and available for IPv6 network performance test.},

abstract={During the development of high-performance processors, software performance models are used to obtain performance estimates. These models are not cycle-accurate, so their results can have significant errors, leading to performance surprises after the hardware is built. Some performance tests can run directly on the logic simulators, to get more accurate results, but those simulators cannot run large interactive workloads with I/O and much operating system code. So the accurate performance estimates from logic simulators are only available for application code, and are not adequate for the evaluation of powerful server systems that are primarily intended to run large interactive workloads. We discuss a software tool system, the "Reverse Tracer", that generates executable performance tests from an instruction trace of the workload. The generated performance tests retain the essential performance characteristics of multi-user I/O-intensive workloads without doing any real I/O, so they can run in logic simulation to measure performance accurately before the hardware is built.},

abstract={Large scale systems (LSS) contain multiple subsystems that interact across multiple nodes in sometimes unforeseen and complicated ways. As a result, pinpointing the subsystems that are the source of performance degradation for a load test in LSS can be frustrating, and might take several hours or even days. This is due to the large volume of performance counter data collected such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption and network traffic, the limited operational knowledge of analysts about all subsystems of an LSS and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in a LSS. We have developed a methodology that automatically ranks the subsystems according to the deviation of their performance in a load test. Our methodology uses performance counter data of a load test to craft performance signatures for the LSS subsystems. Pair-wise correlations among the performance signatures of subsystems within a load test are compared with the corresponding correlations in a baseline test to pinpoint the subsystems responsible for the performance violations. Case studies on load test data obtained from a large telecom system and that of an open source benchmark application show that our approach provides an accuracy of 79% and do not require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate.},

The author illustrates how to implement this critical signal path in a high-speed test system to get high-precision timing and level measurements, particularly for CMOS devices. The solution suggested to embed a CMOS device in a transmission-line environment is the resistive divider. The operating principle of the resistive divider is to apply a definable DC load to the DUT. This maintains signal fidelity, as the signal is fed into a parallel terminated system. Therefore no reflections occur},

According to the definition of NS performance's index, we remodel the split-object model by choosing the proper function and equation in the control theory and deducing the logical coefficent in them. We further evaluate the efficiency and the availability of the new model under NS-2 platform. The results show that the new mode is more suitable for network simulation with higher accuracy.},
