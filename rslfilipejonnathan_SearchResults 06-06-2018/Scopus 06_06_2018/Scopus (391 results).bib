abstract={The specification of workloads is required in order to evaluate performance characteristics of application systems using load testing and model-based performance prediction. Defining workload specifications that represent the real workload as accurately as possible is one of the biggest challenges in both areas. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents an approach that aims to automate the extraction and transformation of workload specifications for load testing and model-based performance prediction of session-based application systems. The approach (WESSBAS) comprises three main components. First, a system- and tool-agnostic domain-specific language (DSL) allows the layered modeling of workload specifications of session-based systems. Second, instances of this DSL are automatically extracted from recorded session logs of production systems. Third, these instances are transformed into executable workload specifications of load generation tools and model-based performance evaluation tools. We present transformations to the common load testing tool Apache JMeter and to the Palladio Component Model. Our approach is evaluated using the industry-standard benchmark SPECjEnterprise2010 and the World Cup 1998 access logs. Workload-specific characteristics (e.g., session lengths and arrival rates) and performance characteristics (e.g., response times and CPU utilizations) show that the extracted workloads match the measured workloads with high accuracy. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Business Model (BM) Innovations aim at making systemic changes in the business logic of companies when they are bringing innovative products and services to the market. Companies should be sensitive to changes in their business environment and able to modify their BMs in an agile way. To assess the agility of BMI during specific market entry situations, this paper uses a method that stress tests the value proposition and the components of a BM against contingent uncertainties. We present three qualitative case studies of companies that differ in their market entry approach. Starting from their strategic orientation, these case companies’ stress test their Business models and BM components, using a scenario-based identification of uncertainties. The BM Stress Test method contributes to a quick understanding of the components their BM needs to monitor, reconsider, or improve. Such stress testing helps enhance business agility. The research contributes to market strategy and business modelling research by introducing BM Stress Testing as a new method that can achieve and maintain agility regarding BM uncertainties. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Standard methodologies of heart rate variability analysis and physiological interpretation as a marker of autonomic nervous system condition have been largely published at rest, but not so much during exercise. A methodological framework for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during exercise is proposed, which deals with the non-stationary nature of HRV during exercise, includes respiratory information, and identifies and corrects spectral components related to cardiolocomotor coupling (CC). This is applied to 23 male subjects who underwent different tests: maximal and submaximal, running and cycling; where the ECG, respiratory frequency and oxygen consumption were simultaneously recorded. High-frequency (HF) power results largely modified from estimations with the standard fixed band to those obtained with the proposed methodology. For medium and high levels of exercise and recovery, HF power results in a 20 to 40% increase. When cycling, HF power increases around 40% with respect to running, while CC power is around 20% stronger in running. © 2017, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract={Context: The performance assessment of complex software systems is not a trivial task since it depends on the design, code, and execution environment. All these factors may affect the system quality and generate negative consequences, such as delays and system failures. The identification of bad practices leading to performance flaws is of key relevance to avoid expensive rework in redesign, reimplementation, and redeployment. Objective: The goal of this manuscript is to provide a systematic process, based on load testing and profiling data, to identify performance issues with runtime data. These performance issues represent an important source of knowledge as they are used to trigger the software refactoring process. Software characteristics and performance measurements are matched with well-known performance antipatterns to document common performance issues and their solutions. Method: We execute load testing based on the characteristics of collected operational profile, thus to produce representative workloads. Performance data from the system under test is collected using a profiler tool to create profiler snapshots and get performance hotspot reports. From such data, performance issues are identified and matched with the specification of antipatterns. Software refactorings are then applied to solve these performance antipatterns. Results: The approach has been applied to a real-world industrial case study and to a representative laboratory study. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool-supported approach that is able to automatically detect two performance antipatterns by exploiting the knowledge of domain experts. In addition, the software refactoring process achieves a significant performance gain at the operational stage in both case studies. Conclusion: Performance antipatterns can be used to effectively support the identification of performance issues from load testing and profiling data. The detection process triggers an antipattern-based software refactoring that in our two case studies results in a substantial performance improvement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.11 standard has become the basis of one of the most successful wireless communication technologies of all time. Originally created to provide wireless connectivity for a few devices, a couple of decades later it may support thousands of users in a single wireless LAN. This fact has made 802.11 a relevant research topic, and as it happens with other wireless technologies, many of the work carried out is based on simulations. In particular, studies for scenarios with high user density are usually performed this way, in many cases leading to conclusions which do not apply to real world situations. This mismatch can be due to multiple factors, such as the specific protocol implementations or the hardware and drivers used. In this article we present a novel 802.11-based testing platform, which aims to bridge the gap between simulations and the real world, in order to carry out research work for typical high density scenarios. The platform is compatible with standard 802.11-based wireless cards on the market and it was tested with two different radios, The validation metrics considered were the TCP throughput, the airtime utilization and the effective data rate, with relative errors ranging from 0 up to 15%. The potential of the tool is illustrated with real world measurements from two example use cases in education facilities: a school classroom and a conference room. The results indicate this might be the first step towards an open platform to enable active Wi-Fi performance testing for large scale scenarios. Further emulation capabilities are shown with different application tests already integrated to the platform, such as QoE tests for YouTube video playback or e-learning platforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High-performance scientific workflows utilize supercomputers, scientific instruments, and large storage systems. Their executions require fast setup of a small number of dedicated network connections across the geographically distributed facility sites.We present Software-Defined Network (SDN) solutions consisting of site daemons that use dpctl, Floodlight, ONOS, or OpenDaylight controllers to set up these connections. The development of these SDN solutions could be quite disruptive to the infrastructure, while requiring a close coordination among multiple sites; in addition, the large number of possible controller and device combinations to investigate could make the infrastructure unavailable to regular users for extended periods of time. In response, we develop a Virtual Science Network Environment (VSNE) using virtual machines, Mininet, and custom scripts that support the development, testing, and evaluation of SDN solutions, without the constraints and expenses of multi-site physical infrastructures; furthermore, the chosen solutions can be directly transferred to production deployments. By complementing VSNE with a physical testbed, we conduct targeted performance tests of various SDN solutions to help choose the best candidates. In addition, we propose a switching response method to assess the setup times and throughput performances of different SDN solutions, and present experimental results that show their advantages and limitations. © 2018 ACM. 978-1-4503-6372-3/18/01. . . $15.00.},

abstract={The most recent financial upheavals have cast doubt on the adequacy of some of the conventional quantitative risk management strategies, such as VaR (Value at Risk), in many common situations. Consequently, there has been an increasing need for verisimilar financial stress testings, namely simulating and analyzing financial portfolios in extreme, albeit rare scenarios. Unlike conventional risk management which exploits statistical correlations among financial instruments, here we focus our analysis on the notion of probabilistic causation, which is embodied by Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs); SBCNs are probabilistic graphical models that have many attractive features in terms of more accurate causal analysis for generating financial stress scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach for conducting stress testing of financial portfolios based on SBCNs in combination with classical machine learning classification tools. The resulting method is shown to be capable of correctly discovering the causal relationships among financial factors that affect the portfolios and thus, simulating stress testing scenarios with a higher accuracy and lower computational complexity than conventional Monte Carlo simulations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Flash translation layers (FTLs) are the core embedded software (also known as firmware) of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs). The relentless pursuit of high-performance SSDs renders FTLs increasingly complex and intricate. Therefore, testing and validating FTLs are crucial and challenging tasks. Directly testing and validating FTLs on SSD hardware are common practices though, they are time-consuming and cumbersome because 1) the testing speed is limited by the hardware speed of SSDs and 2) just reproducing bugs can be challenging, let alone locating and root causing the bugs. This work presents virtual stress testing (VST), a simulation framework to enable executing SSD FTLs on PCs or servers against virtual SRAM, DRAM, and flash emulated by host-side main memory. FTL function calls, such as moving data from flash to DRAM, are served by the VST framework. Therefore, VST can test FTLs without SSD hardware requirements nor SSD speed limitations, and root causing bugs becomes manageable tasks. We apply VST to representative SSD design, OpenSSD, which is actively utilized and maintained by SSD and FTL communities. Experimental results show that VST can test FTLs at a speed up to 375 GB/s, which is several hundred times faster than directly testing FTLs on SSD hardware. Moreover, we successfully discover seven new FTL bugs in the OpenSSD design using VST, which is a solid evidence of VST's bug-discovering effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, thanks to development of advanced IoT technology, the disaster prevention service that helps to search and rescue survivors in the disaster site using robots and special equipment is greatly increased. The introduction of these advanced equipments will help to improve rescue operations within golden time and also ensure the safety of firefighters. However, the disaster environment is still very difficult to approach and pass through it due to collapses, obstacles and dangerous materials. In this paper, we design and implement a mobility performance evaluation test-bed which can overcome various risk situations where a robot and special equipment may encounter while driving and passing them. In addition, the test-bed adopts various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in order to quantitatively evaluate the performance. The test-bed is consists of gaps, continuous ramp, crossing ramp, inclined planes, stairs, vertical climbing, narrow passage, pipe passage, water passage and etc. The level of difficulty for each track can be adjusted to provide a basis for the performance rating of the target robots. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The identification of performance issues and the diagnosis of their root causes are time-consuming and complex tasks, especially in clustered environments. To simplify these tasks, researchers have been developing tools with built-in expertise for practitioners. However, various limitations exist in these tools that prevent their efficient usage in the performance testing of clusters (e.g. the need of manually analysing huge volumes of distributed results). In a previous work, we introduced a policy-based adaptive framework (PHOEBE) that automates the usage of diagnosis tools in the performance testing of clustered systems, in order to improve a tester's productivity, by decreasing the effort and expertise needed to effectively use such tools. This paper extends that work by broadening the set of policies available in PHOEBE, as well as by performing a comprehensive assessment of PHOEBE in terms of its benefits, costs and generality (with respect to the used diagnosis tool). The performed evaluation involved a set of experiments in assessing the different trade-offs commonly experienced by a tester when using a performance diagnosis tool, as well as the time savings that PHOEBE can bring to the performance testing and analysis processes. Our results have shown that PHOEBE can drastically reduce the effort required by a tester to do performance testing and analysis in a cluster. PHOEBE also exhibited consistent behaviour (i.e. similar time-savings and resource utilisations), when applied to a set of commonly used diagnosis tools, demonstrating its generality. Finally, PHOEBE proved to be capable of simplifying the configuration of a diagnosis tool. This was achieved by addressing the identified trade-offs without the need for manual intervention from the tester. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={To evaluate the performance of mobile app designs, designers Andresearchers employ techniques such as A/B, usability, and analytics-driven testing. While these are all useful strategies for evaluating known designs, comparing many divergent solutions to identify the most performant remains a costly and difficult problem. This paper introduces a design performance testing approach that leverages existing app implementations and crowd workers to enable comparative testing at scale. This approach is manifest in ZIPT, a zero-integration performance testing platform that allows designers to collect detailed design and interaction data over any android app -including apps they do not own and did not build. Designers can deploy scripted tests via ZIPT to collect aggregate user performance metrics (e.g., completion rate, time on task) and qualitative feedback over third-party apps. Through case studies, we demonstrate that designers can use ZIPT's aggregate data and visualizations to understand the relative performance of interaction patterns found in the wild, and identify usability issues in existing android apps. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The current software testing in the aspects of industrial benefits gradually causes the attention of the domestic financial bank. The innovation of software technology, the increase of software scale and the shortened developing period make the traditional manual testing meeting enormous challenges, while the development of automated testing technology has promoted the progress of the software testing industry. Because of the particularity of financial and banking services, the bank is under an obligation to ensure the quality and reliability of software. Therefore it's vital to test the software. In specific practice, although the powerful third-party testing tools can be used as a solution, it is hard to rely on certain tool to implement automated testing, hence a framework of automated test is required to be introduced for testing, which intends to handle high efficiency and high-quality testing for software automation. This paper proposes a kind of software automation testing framework based on QTP, mainly targeting on the core of the bank, credit, online banking to test the function of the three major operations. The framework is a secondary development based on QTP and mainly for regression testing of software, which integrates techniques including object recognition, data-driven, and keyword-driven technology, checkpoint technology, to proceed business-level testing. The paper expatiated on four issues, which were the test system design, the test standardization, the testing framework design and the testing of the implementation. The practical application shows that the framework can improve the operational efficiency, reduce the test cost, and guarantee the smooth progress of the software automation testing. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Software testing is the process of testing, verifying and validating the user's requirements. During whole software development, testing is an ongoing process. Black Box, White Box testing and grey box testing are the three main types of software testing. In Black box testing, user doesn't know intrinsic logics and design of system. In white box testing, Tester knows the intrinsic logic of code. In Grey box testing, Tester has little bit knowledge about the internal structure, code and working of the system. It is commonly used in case of Integration testing. Load testing is the type of testing which helps us to analyze the performance of the system under heavy load or under Zero load. With the help of a automated load Testing Tools, we can do it in better way. The intention for writing this research is to carry out a comparison of four automated load testing tools i.e. Apache JMeter, HP LoadRunner, Microsoft Visual Studio (TFS), Siege based on certain criteria i.e. test scripts generation, plug-in support, result reports, application support and cost. The main focus is to study and analyze these load testing tools and identify which tool is best and more efficient [10]. We assume this comparative analysis can help in selecting the most appropriate tool and motivates the use of open source load testing tools. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Large software systems often undergo performance tests to ensure their capability to handle expected loads. These performance tests often consume large amounts of computing resources and time since heavy loads need to be generated. Making it worse, the ever evolving field requires frequent updates to the performance testing environment. In practice, virtual machines (VMs) are widely exploited to provide flexible and less costly environments for performance tests. However, the use of VMs may introduce confounding overhead (e.g., a higher than expected memory utilization with unstable I/O traffic) to the testing environment and lead to unrealistic performance testing results. Yet, little research has studied the impact on test results of using VMs in performance testing activities. To evaluate the discrepancy between the performance testing results from virtual and physical environments, we perform a case study on two open source systems – namely Dell DVD Store (DS2) and CloudStore. We conduct the same performance tests in both virtual and physical environments and compare the performance testing results based on the three aspects that are typically examined for performance testing results: 1) single performance metric (e.g. CPU Time from virtual environment vs. CPU Time from physical environment), 2) the relationship among performance metrics (e.g. correlation between CPU and I/O) and 3) performance models that are built to predict system performance. Our results show that 1) A single metric from virtual and physical environments do not follow the same distribution, hence practitioners cannot simply use a scaling factor to compare the performance between environments, 2) correlations among performance metrics in virtual environments are different from those in physical environments 3) statistical models built based on the performance metrics from virtual environments are different from the models built from physical environments suggesting that practitioners cannot use the performance testing results across virtual and physical environments. In order to assist the practitioners leverage performance testing results in both environments, we investigate ways to reduce the discrepancy. We find that such discrepancy can be reduced by normalizing performance metrics based on deviance. Overall, we suggest that practitioners should not use the performance testing results from virtual environment with the simple assumption of straightforward performance overhead. Instead, practitioners should consider leveraging normalization techniques to reduce the discrepancy before examining performance testing results from virtual and physical environments. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC},

abstract={Nowadays applications need to deal with a large number of concurrent requests. These systems must be stress tested to ensure that they can function correctly under a load. In this context, a research field called Search-based Software Testing has become increasingly important. Most of the search-based test methods are based on single objective optimization. In the case of multi-objective optimization of tests, usually researchers assign different weight values to different objectives and combine them as a single objective. This research paper verifies the use of a multi-objective algorithm in search-based stress testing. The NSGA-II algorithm was implemented in the IAdapter tool using the jMetal framework. IAdapter is a JMeter plugin used for performing search-based stress tests. jMetal is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics. One experiment was conducted to validate the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper the use of self-assessment questionnaires, as opposed to performance testing, is investigated and reported on. A self-assessment questionnaire was administered to 345 first year students entering Higher Education for the first time. Students were assessed before commencing the program: 25 questions, requiring participants to assess their own level of skill, to determine their e-readiness. A subgroup of 55 of these students were subsequently given 3 tasks to perform in a computer laboratory, to assess their e-readiness skills level. The efficiency, accuracy and reliability of the two methods were compared. It was concluded that, based on the efficiency, accuracy and depth of knowledge gained, self-assessment is a valuable tool. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The rise of the Internet of things (IoT) poses massive scalability issues for location-based services. More particularly, location-aware publish and subscribe services are struggling to scale out the computation of matches between publications and subscriptions that continuously update their location. In this demonstration paper, we propose a novel distributed and horizontally scalable architecture for location-aware publish and subscribe. Our middleware architecture relies on a multi-step routing mechanism based on consistent hashing and range partitioning. To demonstrate its scalability, we present a traffic data generator, which, in contrast to existing generators, can be used to perform real-time load tests. Finally, we show that our architecture can be deployed on a small 10-node cluster and can process up to 80,000 location updates per second producing 25,000 matches per seconds. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent research in scalable model-driven engineering now allows very large models to be stored and queried. Due to their size, rather than transferring such models over the network in their entirety, it is typically more efficient to access them remotely using networked services (e.g. model repositories, model indexes). Little attention has been paid so far to the nature of these services, and whether they remain responsive with an increasing number of concurrent clients. This paper extends a previous empirical study on the impact of certain key decisions on the scalability of concurrent model queries on two domains, using an Eclipse Connected Data Objects model repository, four configurations of the Hawk model index and a Neo4j-based configuration of the NeoEMF model store. The study evaluates the impact of the network protocol, the API design, the caching layer, the query language and the type of database and analyses the reasons for their varying levels of performance. The design of the API was shown to make a bigger difference compared to the network protocol (HTTP/TCP) used. Where available, the query-specific indexed and derived attributes in Hawk outperformed the comprehensive generic caching in CDO. Finally, the results illustrate the still ongoing evolution of graph databases: two tools using different versions of the same backend had very different performance, with one slower than CDO and the other faster than it. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Large-scale software systems like Amazon and healthcare.gov are used by thousands or millions of people every day. To ensure the quality of these systems, load testing is a required testing procedure in addition to the conventional functional testing techniques like unit and system integration testing. One of the important requirements of load testing is to create a field-like test environment. Unfortunately, this task is often very challenging due to reasons like security and rapid field updates. In this paper, we have conducted an exploratory study on the impact of environment variations on the results of load tests. We have run over 110 hours load tests, which examine the system's behavior under load with various changes (e.g., installing an antivirus program) to the targeted deployment environment. We call such load tests as environment-variation-based load tests. Case studies in three open source systems have shown that there is a clear performance impact on the system's performance due to these environment changes. Different scenarios react differently to the changes in the underlying computing resources. When predicting the performance of the system under environment changes that are not previously load tested, our ensemble models out-perform (24%-94% better) the baseline models. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Concurrent data structures are often tested under stress to detect bugs that can only be exposed by some rare interleavings of instructions. A typical stress test for a concurrent data structure creates a number of threads that repeatedly invoke methods of the target data structure. After a failure is detected by a stress test, developers need to localize the fault causing the failure. However, the execution trace of a failed stress test may be very long, making it time-consuming to replay the failure and localize the fault. In this paper, we present an approach to minimizing stress tests for concurrent data structures. Our approach is to create a smaller test that still produces the same failure by removing some of the threads and/or method invocations in the original stress test. We apply delta debugging to identify the threads and method invocations that are essential for causing the failure. Other threads and method invocations are removed to create a smaller stress test. To increase the chance of triggering the original failure during the execution of the new stress test, we force the new execution to replay the original failed execution trace when possible, and try to guide the execution back to the failed trace when the execution diverges. We describe a tool called TestMinimizer and report the results of an empirical study in which TestMinimizer was applied to 16 real-life concurrent data structures. The results of our evaluation showed that TestMinimizer can effectively and efficiently minimize the stress tests for these concurrent data structures. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of system software and hardware components for Android devices is strongly influenced by the necessity to save energy. However, there is no methodology that provides developers with reproducible and comparable benchmarks for testing the device under a representative load. Such a benchmark would have to stimulate all relevant parts of the system and must neither depend on the current state of external servers in the Internet nor on any interactive user. This paper describes the first steps towards such a bench mark. The approach is based on recorded workload traces of prominent Android applications. From these traces we can " mix a cocktail" that yields a representative workload profile. By replaying the recorded and mixed loads with a workload generator combined with an external environment for dealing with communication workloads we obtain benchmarks that fulfill the requirements. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={A multi-tier Internet server application needs to be analyzed for its performance before it is released. Performance analysis is usually done by (a) load testing of the application on a testbed and (b) building a performance model of the application. While there are a plethora of Web load-generator tools available, there are two problems with these tools: one, the tests have to be configured manually, which can lead to a time-consuming trial-and-error process until the desired performance charts in the appropriate load ranges are obtained; and two, the load generator tools do not produce output that is directly useful for creating a performance model of the application. In this paper, we present AutoPerf, a load generator tool designed to meet two distinct goals, named capacity analysis and profiling. The goal of capacity analysis is to run a comprehensive load test on a Web application, in an appropriately chosen range, at a minimal number of load levels, while still producing an accurate graph of throughput and response time vs load levels. The goal of profiling is to generate a detailed server resource usage profile per request type, without instrumenting the application code. This data (e.g. CPU execution time by Web server for one request) is crucial for parameterizing performance models of the application. AutoPerf intelligently plans and configures its load tests by using analytical results from queuing theory along with some heuristics. Results show that AutoPerf is able to run performance tests very efficiently while still producing an accurate chart of performance metrics. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The usage of open source (OS) software is wide-spread across many industries. While the functional quality of OS projects is considered to be similar to closed-source software, much is unknown about the quality in terms of performance. One challenge for OS developers is that, unlike for functional testing, there is a lack of accepted best practices for performance testing. To reveal the state of practice of performance testing in OS projects, we conduct an exploratory study on 111 Java-based OS projects from GitHub. We study the performance tests of these projects from five perspectives: (1) developers, (2) size, (3) test organization, (4) types of performance tests and (5) used tooling. We show that writing performance tests is not a popular task in OS projects: performance tests form only a small portion of the test suite, are rarely updated, and are usually maintained by a small group of core project developers. Further, even though many projects are aware that they need performance tests, developers appear to struggle implementing them. We argue that future performance testing frameworks should provider better support for low-friction testing, for instance via non-parameterized methods or performance test generation, as well as focus on a tight integration with standard continuous integration tooling. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The evolution of cloud-computing imposes many challenges on performance testing and requires not only a different approach and methodology of performance evaluation and analysis, but also specialized tools and frameworks to support such work. In traditional performance testing, typically a single workload was run against a static test configuration. The main metrics derived from such experiments included throughput, response times, and system utilization at steady-state. While this may have been sufficient in the past, where in many cases a single application was run on dedicated hardware, this approach is no longer suitable for cloud-based deployments. Whether private or public cloud, such environments typically host a variety of applications on distributed shared hardware resources, simultaneously accessed by a large number of tenants running heterogeneous workloads. The number of tenants as well as their activity and resource needs dynamically change over time, and the cloud infrastructure reacts to this by reallocating existing or provisioning new resources. Besides metrics such as the number of tenants and overall resource utilization, performance testing in the cloud must be able to answer many more questions: How is the quality of service of a tenant impacted by the constantly changing activity of other tenants? How long does it take the cloud infrastructure to react to changes in demand, and what is the effect on tenants while it does so? How well are service level agreements met? What is the resource consumption of individual tenants? How can global performance metrics on application- and system-level in a distributed system be correlated to an individual tenant's perceived performance? In this paper we present CloudPerf, a performance test framework specifically designed for distributed and dynamic multi-tenant environments, capable of answering all of the above questions, and more. CloudPerf consists of a distributed harness, a protocol-independent load generator and workload modeling framework, an extensible statistics framework with live-monitoring and post-analysis tools, interfaces for cloud deployment operations, and a rich set of both lowlevel as well as high-level workloads from different domains. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Quantum mechanical embedding theories partition a complex system into multiple spatial regions that can use different electronic structure methods within each, to optimize trade-offs between accuracy and cost. The present work incorporates accurate but expensive correlated wave function (CW) methods for a subsystem containing the phenomenon or feature of greatest interest, while self-consistently capturing quantum effects of the surroundings using fast but less accurate density functional theory (DFT) approximations. We recently proposed two embedding methods [for a review, see: Acc. Chem. Res. 2014, 47, 2768 ]: density functional embedding theory (DFET) and potential functional embedding theory (PFET). DFET provides a fast but non-self-consistent density-based embedding scheme, whereas PFET offers a more rigorous theoretical framework to perform fully self-consistent, variational CW/DFT calculations [as defined in part 1, CW/DFT means subsystem 1(2) is treated with CW(DFT) methods]. When originally presented, PFET was only tested at the DFT/DFT level of theory as a proof of principle within a planewave (PW) basis. Part 1 of this two-part series demonstrated that PFET can be made to work well with mixed Gaussian type orbital (GTO)/PW bases, as long as optimized GTO bases and consistent electron-ion potentials are employed throughout. Here in part 2 we conduct the first PFET calculations at the CW/DFT level and compare them to DFET and full CW benchmarks. We test the performance of PFET at the CW/DFT level for a variety of types of interactions (hydrogen bonding, metallic, and ionic). By introducing an intermediate CW/DFT embedding scheme denoted DFET/PFET, we show how PFET remedies different types of errors in DFET, serving as a more robust type of embedding theory. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Load-stress test is the experimental performance analysis in extreme traffic and density conditions, routinely required to validate any innovative radio access solution. This article focuses on load-stress test specifically designed for the two-hop architecture that enables the onboard connectivity in HSTs. The load-stress condition of train-to-infrastructure communication for a massive number of onboard UEs is very challenging, as it needs to account for extreme conditions and a complex testing environment. The load-stress method proposed in this article is for a ground network supporting onboard wireless connectivity in HSTs, and is validated for commercial eNBs from LTE cellular networks (Rel-11). The in-lab experimental setup is arranged by virtualizing multiple eNBs serving multiple cells, arranged sequentially along a line to simulate the HST track with a massive number of active onboard UEs. The focus of the experimental load-stress test is the analysis of the impact of Doppler shift and interruptions caused by the frequent HOs of multiple consecutive groups of UEs deployed in HST carriages at the speed of 300 km/h. The HO interruption time is characterized statistically based on the number of active UEe. The consequent impairments on the experienced QoS for high-throughput and low-latency services such as FTP and VoLTE are verified. This article validates experimentally the traffic and HO latency improvements (approximately threefold) in a multi-cell access scheme when the coverage of every single carriage is augmented by fixed directional antennas to offload UEs toward far-away eNBs along the train track. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

Although the need to perform similar spatial environment based testing remains, the push towards mmWave communication links with beamforming arrays containing potentially hundreds of elements and extremely narrow beams will exceed the practical resolution limits of the boundary array approach. At the same time, these devices will incorporate chip scale antennas that are tightly integrated to the radio design, requiring a valid over-the-air test methodology to be able to evaluate the radio performance. © 2016 AMTA.},

abstract={Nowadays, in industries, Testing has become one of the important tasks. Testing is necessary for an effective performance of product and software applications. When companies having a mass production of hardware boards, it is necessary to do testing of each and every module of hardware like SPI, UART, GPIO, PWM, ADC, USB, Ethernet. If we do testing manually then it will significantly take more time, which we can be reduced by automation testing. But the solution is not an automation testing because automation testing also requires the same amount of system, for example for 300 boards 300 system is required. The only difference in manual and automation testing is that in automation testing it will require less human effort. Now we are focusing more on developing a solution in which many tests can be done on one single system i.e. for 300 boards only one system is required for testing hence this problem can be solved by Yocto Project. Yocto project have build the tool named Bitbake which is written in Python language, which works on multithreading and scheduling so that simultaneously you can test more boards on a single system. In this paper we did automation testing of GPIO pins using Yocto project. © 2017 IEEE.},

Load testing is one of the techniques in software testing and is used to find the maximum load that software can handle without affecting its performance. Load testing is used to test the cloud services that are running in a cloud. All the resources in a cloud are used by the cloud users based on their demand. Using cloud, it is easy to gather the required load for a particular application by forming clusters. If the required load is coming from different clusters and it is not known quantitatively then the problem of load balancing is raised. The proposed load testing tool avoids the problem of getting unequal loads coming from different clusters by distributing the same amount of load to all the clusters. Also the proposed load testing tool for cloud is used to find the maximum number of simultaneous users for a particular cloud system is to handle. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.},

For the implementation of such service backends, load tests are required to ensure their performance and scalability. However, existing tools like JMeter are not able to simulate "out of the box" a load distribution with the complex time evolution of heterogeneous, real and interacting users of a social app, which e.g. would be necessary to detect critical performance bottlenecks. Therefore, in this paper a probabilistic model for simulating interacting users of a social app is proposed and evaluated by implementing it in a prototype load testing tool and using it to test a backend of new real-world social app currently under development.

abstract={The most recent financial upheavals have cast doubt on the adequacy of some of the conventional quantitative risk management strategies, such as VaR (Value at Risk), in many common situations. Consequently, there has been an increasing need for verisimilar financial stress testings, namely simulating and analyzing financial portfolios in extreme, albeit rare scenarios. Unlike conventional risk management which exploits statistical correlations among financial instruments, here we focus our analysis on the notion of probabilistic causation, which is embodied by Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs), SBCNs are probabilistic graphical models that have many attractive features in terms of more accurate causal analysis for generating financial stress scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach for conducting stress testing of financial portfolios based on SBCNs in combination with classical machine learning classification tools. The resulting method is shown to be capable of correctly discovering the causal relationships among financial factors that affect the portfolios and thus, simulating stress testing scenarios with a higher accuracy and lower computational complexity than conventional Monte Carlo Simulations. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, or things, with embedded electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity. The connection of all these things leverages value generation, by offering new services and strategic information. In order to make the Internet of Things possible, the integration of many technologies is necessary, such as machine-To-machine and cyber-physical systems. The process of testing IoT applications introduces new challenges because it does not only includes typical test strategies and methodologies. Testing an IoT system depends on its the specific configuration, and it also needs to consider the hardware platform and the network environment. Currently, industry and academy efforts are focusing on usability and connectivity tests, such as: simulating the environment where the device is to be used, and ensuring information is exchanged in a secure manner. In this paper, we use the current version of our IoT platform to perform stress testing of our IoT platform under different conditions. Our test methodology for IoT applications is also presented. Three different hardware platforms have been used for performing the stress testing of our platform. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the wake of an increasingly digital economy, businesses are racing to build operational knowledge around the vast sums of data they produce each day. And with data now at the center of almost every business function, developing practices for working with data is critical regardless of your company's size or industry. AWS Kinesis Stream provides a platform to consume these data from various sources and process them for analytical purposes. In the current age of Digital Marketing the important aspect which comes to play is the speed at which you can process the data. The AWS Cloud provides a broad set of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking and databases that are delivered as a utility: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. Amazon Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS, offering powerful services to make it easy to load and analyze streaming data, and also providing the ability for to build custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. To ensure the timely execution as well to determine the proper infrastructure to host the Kinesis Stream it is very important to execute a through performance test of the Kinesis Stream application. The Data Message flow to kinesis Stream gets authenticated using AES256 encryption which most of performance testing tools (e.g. Loadrunner) doesn't supports. This paper presents a succinct approach to implement the performance testing steps overcoming the authentication issue and execute Load Test on Kinesis Stream. The approach explains how to overcome the authentication issue with the help of Node.js and integrate it with Loadrunner and execute the performance test. The paper also provides details on the critical metrics to be monitored from CloudWatch for analyzing the Kinesis Stream performance. AWS provides its own monitoring through service called CloudWatch. This document also provides insight on the monitoring steps using CloudWatch during the performance testing. In Summary this paper provides an approach for testing Kinesis Stream with help of Node.js. The paper also provides benefits on the approach and how it can be utilized for other tools and testing approaches. © imPACt 2017 - Internet, Mobile, Performance and Capacity, Cloud and Technology.

abstract={Streak Cameras are an essential diagnostic tool used in shock physics and high energy density physics experiments. Such experiments require well calibrated temporally resolved diagnostics for studying events that occur in the nanosecond to microsecond time scales. Although streak cameras are among the most common detectors used within the high energy density physics community, they require frequent calibration and typically lack reproducibility in the fine detail. A solid state device with similar temporal performance characteristics could provide several advantages to current streak camera systems by utilizing discrete spatial resolution set by the sensor diodes. National Security Technologies (NSTec) has built a multi-channel solid state streak camera (SSSC) prototype, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories, as part of an ongoing project to develop the technology to a level competitive with analog streak cameras. The device concept and results from electronic testing of our first prototypes will be discussed in this manuscript. These measurements will be used as a base for future SSSC development projects. © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.},

abstract={Due to a significant spectral overlap between the motion artifact and underlying photoplethysmogram (PPG), reliable automated PPG analysis in real-life environment may be challenging. To evaluate the impact of motion artifact on the accuracy of automated PPG pulse detection, we designed a noise stress test (NST) in which artifact-bearing (noise-added) recordings are assembled from actual recordings by selecting intervals that contain predominantly motion artifact. To assemble the NST database, we analyzed 2000 synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG recordings from MIMIC-II database. One-minute segments with the highest and lowest agreement between the ECG beats and the PPG pulses were selected using a semi-automated protocol. The resulting NST database included 52 artifact-free base recordings by visually selecting clean segments with normal pulse rate and rhythm, and 10 pure artifact recordings by selecting segments with negligible spectral content from the base signal. Cross combination of the base and artifact recordings, by calibrating the level of added artifact, generated 520 one-minute PPG signals for each desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For each combined signal, the performance of automatic pulse detection and time-domain pulse rate variability analysis was evaluated by using the annotations from artifact-free base recordings as reference. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society.

abstract={In the spring of 2012, as part of a ‘hub and spoke’ model of research to address the human performance concerns related to current as well as new and advanced control room designs and operations, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) sponsored a project to procure a low cost simulator to empirically measure and study human performance aspects of control room operations. Using this simulator, the Human Factors and Reliability Branch (HFRB) in the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) began a program of research known as the NRC Human Performance Test Facility (HPTF) to collect empirical human performance data with the purpose of measuring and ultimately better understanding the various cognitive and physical elements that support safe control room operation. To accomplish this, HFRB first procured two 3-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor simulators with the capability to run a full range of power operation scenarios. HFRB staff work as co-investigators along with a team of researchers at the University of Central Florida (UCF) to design and carry-out a series of experiments aimed at measuring and understanding the human performance aspects of common control room tasks through the use of a variety of physiological and self-report metrics. The intent was to design experiments that balanced domain realism and laboratory control sufficiently to collect systematic, yet meaningful human performance data related to execution of common main control room (MCR) tasks. Investigators identified and defined three types of tasks that are examined in the present project: Checking, Detection, and Response Implementation. Task type presentation was partially counterbalanced to maintain ecologic validity with experimental control. A variety of subjective and physiological measures were used to understand performance of those tasks in terms ofworkload. The simulator used to collect these data was a digital representation of a generic analog NPP MCR interface. The data resulting from this experimentation enhances the current information gathering process, allowing for more robust technical bases to support regulatory guidance development and decision making. The present paper describes the approach behind this research effort. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

Jattack has been initially conceived with the primary objective of performing a thorough scalability analysis of the well-known Janus WebRTC gateway. As such, it re-uses most of the Janus core stack components in order to reliably emulate the behavior of a dynamically adjustable number of WebRTC clients. The specific testing scenario can indeed be programmatically reproduced by writing a small controller component, which takes on the responsibility of properly orchestrating the scenario itself. The general-purpose nature of the tool, together with its flexibility deriving from the controller-based programmable approach, makes Jattack also suitable for stress-testing other WebRTC-enabled servers. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The microservices architecture provides a new approach to develop applications. As opposed to monolithic applications, in which the application comprises a single software artifact, an application based on the microservices architecture is composed by a set of services, each one designed to perform a single and well-defined task. These services allow the development team to decouple several parts of the application using different frameworks, languages and hardware for each part of the system. One of the drawbacks for adopting the microservices architecture to develop applications is testability. In a single application test boundaries can be more easily established and tend to be more stable as the application evolves, while with microservices we can have a set of hundreds of services that operate together and are prone to change more rapidly. Each one of these services needs to be tested and updated as the service changes. In addition, the different characteristics of these services such as languages, frameworks or the used infrastructure have to be considered in the testing phase. Performance tests are applied to assure that a particular software complies with a set of non-functional requirements such as throughput and response time. These metrics are important to ensure that business constraints are respected and to help finding performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a new approach to allow the performance tests to be executed in an automated way, with each microservice providing a test specification that is used to perform tests. Along with the architecture, we also provide a framework that implements some key concepts of this architecture. This framework is available as an open source project1. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The scalability of model-related operations (e.g., model transformations), when they are to be applied in industrial model-driven engineering, becomes an important issue. However, there is a lack of an automated performance testing framework for those operations, since the existing ones for ordinary programs are ill-suited. Such a framework is required to provide the function of creating and organizing test cases, and the ability of generating test input of large size automatically, because large scale models are not widely available, making it hard to test the performance and coverage of those operations without any bias. This paper proposes a performance testing framework, integrated with a random model generation algorithm, for model-related operations. The framework, based on a test model, can be used to specify and arrange test cases into test suites. And the model generation algorithm can generate a random model correctly and efficiently, according to the metamodel and user-defined constraints. Finally, we present two case studies, one experiment in randomness, and two experiments in generation efficiency to evaluate the framework and algorithm. Results show that the framework is competent to support performance testing of model-related operations, and the algorithm is random and efficient enough to generate test data for performance testing. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Modern active phased array radars are made to optimize the size, weight and power without compromising its capability to combat with advanced electronic warfare. To accomplish this task, the signal is digitized at element level or at sub-array level and processed with the help of advanced digital signal processor. Proving the capabilities of this firmware at bench level helps to reduce the overall development time. Hence, it is necessary to have a built-in test unit or test vector generator to verify the optimal performance of digital modules. The best way to accomplish this goal is to use a high speed baseband I & Q radar data generator which helps in testing, identifying and segregating the problems at various stages. In this paper we have explored the capability of latest general purpose graphical processing unit (GP-GPU) as software defined built in test vector generator with high throughput for active array radar applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance load tests of online transaction processing (OLTP) applications are expensive in terms of manpower, time and costs. Alternative performance modeling and prediction tools are required to generate accurate outputs with minimal input sample points. Service Demands (time needed to serve 1 request at queuing stations) are typically needed as inputs by most performance models. However, as service demands vary as a function of workload, models that input singular service demands produce erroneous predictions. The alternative, which is to collect service demands at varying workloads, require time and resource intensive load tests to estimate multiple sample points - this defeats the purpose of performance modeling for industrial use. In this paper, we propose a service demand model as a function of concurrency that can be estimated with a single-user performance test. Further, we analyze multiple CPU performance metrics (cache hits/misses, branch prediction, context switches and so on) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract a regression function of service demand with increasing workloads. We use the service demand models as input to performance prediction algorithms such as Mean Value Analysis (MVA), to accurately predict throughput at varying workloads. This service demand prediction model uses CPU hardware counters, which is used in conjunction with a modified version of MVA with single-user service demand inputs. The predicted throughput values are within 9% deviation with measurements procured for a variety of application/hardware configurations. Such a service demand model is a step towards reducing reliance on conventional load testing for performance assurance. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Stress testing is used to measure the performance of the heart in an elevated stress state, in order to monitor or diagnose certain heart problems. Many measurements can be used to determine the performance of the heart, with the Tei index being the measurement of interest in this work. The Tei index has been used as a reliable method to evaluate systolic and diastolic performance, as it overcomes some limitations of the classical echocardiographic indices. It is calculated based on the time intervals derived from echocardiography. This paper presents an exploratory study, which uses an accelerometer to record mechanical events occurring in each cardiac cycle, also known as the seismocardiogram (SCG). From timing measurements corresponding to various events in the heart, a metric for myocardial performance is calculated based on the Tei index. The use of SCG in addition to ECG has the potential to provide further insights about the heart during stress testing, since the SCG quantifies mechanical actions of the heart. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Financial networks, creating potential propagation channels for shocks in crises, are widely viewed as a key factor to systemic stability. In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of deleveraging in an overlapping network of assets. We study the deleveraging spirals driven by the interaction between fire sales and confidence effects, and show how distress is amplified and propagated throughout the network. Using the regulatory data from the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), we construct the assets overlapping network and then apply the model to the system. The result suggests that: (1) the mutually reinforcing effects of fire sales and confidence can contribute to contagion significantly; (2) The vulnerability of the system are largely dependant on the distribution of large illiquid assets. Our model provides a ready-to-use yet powerful stress testing tool for macro-prudential regulation. © 2016 TCCT.},

abstract={Managing tail latency of requests has become one of the primary challenges for large-scale Internet services. Data centers are quickly evolving and service operators frequently desire to make changes to the deployed software and production hardware configurations. Such changes demand a confident understanding of the impact on one's service, in particular its effect on tail latency (e.g., 95th-or 99th-percentile response latency of the service). Evaluating the impact on the tail is challenging because of its inherent variability. Existing tools and methodologies for measuring these effects suffer from a number of deficiencies including poor load tester design, statistically inaccurate aggregation, and improper attribution of effects. As shown in the paper, these pitfalls can often result in misleading conclusions. In this paper, we develop a methodology for statistically rigorous performance evaluation and performance factor attribution for server workloads. First, we find that careful design of the server load tester can ensure high quality performance evaluation, and empirically demonstrate the inaccuracy of load testers in previous work. Learning from the design flaws in prior work, we design and develop a modular load tester platform, Treadmill, that overcomes pitfalls of existing tools. Next, utilizing Treadmill, we construct measurement and analysis procedures that can properly attribute performance factors. We rely on statistically-sound performance evaluation and quantile regression, extending it to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of server systems. Finally, we use our augmented methodology to evaluate the impact of common server hardware features with Facebook production workloads on production hardware. We decompose the effects of these features on request tail latency and demonstrate that our evaluation methodology provides superior results, particularly in capturing complicated and counter-intuitive performance behaviors. By tuning the hardware features as suggested by the attribution, we reduce the 99th-percentile latency by 43% and its variance by 93%. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In our previous study, we investigated the effects of different packaging materials (silicone and phosphor layer) on the reliability of high power light-emitting diodes (HPLEDs) by highly accelerated stress test (HAST). The experimental results showed that the LED samples' lumen maintenance property might have dependence on the silicone amount in the package. In this paper, we further studied the effect of silicone amount on the lumen maintenance under HAST. Five categories of LED specimens specified by silicone amount were prepared and subjected to an isothermal chamber whose temperature was set at 125 °C. An online testing system was used to monitor and record the light outputs in real time during the experimental process. After 400 hours of aging, the largest attenuating range reached 6.17% and different groups display different degradation behaviors. An exponential decay model was adopted to calculate the decay rate of each lumen maintenance curve. The decay rate differs as the silicone amount inside the package modules changes. This phenomenon is well explained and Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations are carried out to validate the explanation. The interaction effect of both silicone amount and temperature is also found and more researches need to be done for further study. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Large-scale software systems like Amazon and eBay must be load tested to ensure they can handle hundreds and millions of current requests in the field. Load testing usually lasts for a few hours or even days and generates large volumes of system behavior data (execution logs and counters). This data must be properly analyzed to check whether there are any performance problems in a load test. However, the sheer size of the data prevents effective manual analysis. In addition, unlike functional tests, there is usually no test oracle associated with a load test. To cope with these challenges, there have been many analysis techniques proposed to automatically detect problems in a load test by comparing the behavior of the current test against previous test(s). Unfortunately, none of these techniques compare their performance against each other. In this paper, we have proposed a framework, which evaluates and compares the effectiveness of different test analysis techniques. We have evaluated a total of 23 test analysis techniques using load testing data from three open source systems. Based on our experiments, we have found that all the test analysis techniques can effectively build performance models using data from both buggy or non-buggy tests and flag the performance deviations between them. It is more cost-effective to compare the current test against two recent previous test(s), while using testing data collected under longer sampling intervals (≤ 180 seconds). Among all the test analysis techniques, Control Chart, Descriptive Statistics and Regression Tree yield the best performance. Our evaluation framework and findings can be very useful for load testing practitioners and researchers. To encourage further research on this topic, we have made our testing data publicity available to download. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The European banking system has been under considerable pressure since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007–2008. Except for the global credit crunch, the European sovereign debt crisis has created additional difficulties. In response to the need for increasing the transparency and stability in the European financial/banking system and identifying weaknesses in banks’ capital structures, EU-wide stress tests have been performed by the European Banking Authority (EBA) on a regular basis since 2010. In this context, the aim of this study is to examine the financial performance of the European banks that have participated in the stress tests of EBA. The analysis takes into account the actual financial data of the banks, on the basis of the Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, Liquidity framework, as well the results of the stress tests. The evaluation of the banks’ financial strength is performed through a robust multicriteria decision aid classification methodology. The latter is used to distinguish between the banks, which failed to meet the minimum capital requirement conditions imposed by EBA, and the well-capitalized ones. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={There are many applications where the operational environment of the antenna is challenging, which means its impedance can be highly variable, so the RF PA needs to be able to operate over a wide variety of loads without stress or failure. Assessing this is a key requirement of reliability testing, with VSWR sweeps being a typical way to test this durability. It is important to make sure the amount of information gained from these sweeps is maximized, so adding RF I-V waveform information can help give a more accurate view of what is occurring at the current generator plane. Also if the fundamental and second harmonic loads are systematically swept significant voltage stress, possibly not seen during the current conventional VSWR tests, is observed, which has implications in both the output matching network design and the current method of testing. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the increased loading the large number of users connected to pervasive web services during the past decade, their load testing and providing the needed resources in low time and cost, requires more attention. In this context cloud computing technology offers new ideas to solve such problems and has reduced the concern of large and complex testing systems. In this research in order to improve the quality and performance of web applications load testing, we proposed a method for web applications load testing based on cloud computing. The proposed method uses the existing facilities in the cloud including pool of computing resources without initial cost, unlimited data storage and cloud computing managerial procedures, containing the actual load generating and multi-user concurrency testing, that lead to improved load testing flexibility, time and operational costs. Moreover, in this load testing method, in order to manage resources and virtual machines, significant improvement is achieved by use of appropriate allocation, reducing performance and unnecessary migration avoiding methods. Through evaluation section of the proposed method through a simulated test environment, it is shown that cloud-based load testing in comparison with traditional methods of load testing, improves factors such as effort, cost and time. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a tendency to move production environments from corporate-owned data centers to cloud-based services. Users who do not maintain a private production environment might not wish to maintain a private performance test environment either. The application of performance engineering methods to the development and delivery of software systems is complicated when the form and or parameters of the target deployment environment cannot be controlled or determined. The difficulty of diagnosing the causes of performance issues during testing or production may be increased by the presence of highly variable workloads on the target platform that compete with the application of interest for resources in ways that might be hard to determine. In particular, performance tests might be conducted in virtualized environments that introduce factors influencing customer-affecting metrics (such as transaction response time) and observed resource usage. Observed resource usage metrics in virtualized environments can have different meanings from those in a native environment. Virtual machines may suffer delays in execution. We explore factors that exacerbate these complications. We argue that these complexities reinforce the case for rigorously using software performance engineering methods rather than diminishing it. We also explore possible performance testing methods for mitigating the risk associated with these complexities.},

abstract={Software testing is a vital activity that is undertaken during software engineering life cycle to ensure software quality and reliability. Performance testing is a type of software testing that is done to shows how web application behaves under a certain workload. Cloud computing as an emerging technology can be used in the field of software engineering to provide cloud testing in order to overcome all deficiencies of conventional testing by leveraging cloud computing resources. As a result, testing-as-a-service (TaaS) is introduced as a service model that performs all testing activities in fully automated manner, on demand with a pay-for use basis. Moreover, TaaS increases testing efficiency and reduces time and cost required for testing. In this paper, performance TaaS framework for web applications is introduced which provides all performance testing activities including automatic test case generation and test execution. In addition, the proposed framework addresses many issues as: maximize resource utilization and continuous monitoring to ensure system reliability. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Load testing is the process of applying ordinary stress to a software system to determine the system performance under normal conditions. In a typical load testing lifecycle, three kinds of service tools are involved: test case recording service tools that make testers easier to generate test cases through a web browsing-like behavior; test case execution service tools that exercise test cases with simulations of a large number of concurrent users; system resource monitoring service tools that provide information of system footprints during the test case executions. However, using these three kinds of service tools one by one to complete a load testing may require extra effort on operating and configuring each service. In this paper, we proposed a framework for composing the three types of service tools as an integrated service for load testing. A raw test case recorded by Badboy tool is automatically converted into an expanded test case that can be executed by JMeter. JMeter and Cacti are then automatically invoked by the framework. The execution time period of JMeter is automatically identified as the input to Cacti for resource monitoring of the system under test. The test report together with system footprints is also automatically generated. In the experimental evaluation, the result shows that the framework significantly save time on operating and configuring the load testing service tools than the traditional approach under a t-test. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In order to reduce software complexity and be power efficient, hardware platforms are increasingly incorporating functionality that was traditionally administered at a software-level (such as cache management). This functionality is often complex, incorporating multiple processors along with a multitude of design parameters. Such devices can only be reliably tested at a ‘system’ level, which presents various testing challenges; behaviour is often non-deterministic (from a software perspective), and finding suitable test sets to ‘stress’ the system adequately is often an inefficient, manual activity that yields fixed test sets that can rarely be reused. In this paper we investigate this problem with respect to ARM’s Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI) Unit. We present an automated search-based testing approach that combines a parameterised testgeneration framework with the hill-climbing heuristic to find test sets that maximally ‘stress’ the CCI by producingmuch larger numbers of data stall cycles than the corresponding manual test sets. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={As a new era of “Big Data” comes, contemporary database management systems (DBMS) introduced new functions to satisfy new requirements for big volume and velocity applications. Although the development agenda goes at full pace, the current testing agenda does not keep up, especially to validate non-functional requirements, such as: performance and scalability. The testing approaches strongly rely on the combination of unit testing tools and benchmarks. There is still a testing methodology missing, in which testers can model the runtime environment of the DBMS under test, defining the testing goals and the harness support for executing test cases. The major contribution of this paper is the MoDaST (Model-based Database Stress Testing) approach that leverages a state transition model to reproduce a runtime DBMS with dynamically shifting workload volumes and velocity. Each state in the model represents the possible running states of the DBMS. Therefore, testers can define state goals or specific state transitions that revealed bugs. Testers can also use MoDaST to pinpoint the conditions of performance loss and thrashing states. We put MoDaST to practical application testing two popular DBMS: PostgreSQL and VoltDB. The results show that MoDaST can reach portions of source code that are only possible with non-functional testing. Among the defects revealed by MoDaST, when increasing the code coverage, we highlight a defect confirmed by the developers of VoltDB as a major bug and promptly fixed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The degradation behaviors of 980-nm emitting nominally identical single-spatial mode lasers are studied during continuous wave long-term operation and during single-pulse stress tests. Both tests activate internal catastrophic optical damage as sudden degradation mechanism limiting the device lifetime. In case of high power stress-testing, the mechanism that initializes this effect is a spatial widening of the optical mode, resulting in increased absorption outside the waveguide. A similar disturbance to the optical mode is caused by defects that are generated during long-term operation. Thus two very different aging regimes eventually result in the same degradation scenario. We find that singlepulse stress-testing allows for activation of several degradation mechanisms in a device one after the other. Moreover, it becomes possible to distinguish between effects induced by gradual degradation and such that are independent on operation time. Thus stress-testing is considered a complementary tool, which might pave the way towards more economic device testing. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={Spark has emerged as an easy to use, scalable, robust and fast system for analytics with a rapidly growing and vibrant community of users and contributors. It is multipurpose—with extensive and modular infrastructure for machine learning, graph processing, SQL, streaming, statistical processing, and more. Its rapid adoption therefore calls for a performance assessment suite that supports agile development, measurement, validation, optimization, configuration, and deployment decisions across a broad range of platform environments and test cases. Recognizing the need for such comprehensive and agile testing, this paper proposes going beyond existing performance tests for Spark and creating an expanded Spark performance testing suite. This proposal describes several desirable properties flowing from the larger scale, greater and evolving variety, and nuanced requirements of different applications of Spark. The paper identifies the major areas of performance characterization, and the key methodological aspects that should be factored into the design of the proposed suite. The objective is to capture insights from industry and academia on how to best characterize capabilities of Spark-based analytic platforms and provide cost-effective assessment of optimization opportunities in a timely manner. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

The welding stress was detected by the FBG networks in turn according to the welding sequence, and the closer the FBG was to welding seam, the greater the welding stress was.

abstract={Load testing is an important part of the performance engineering process. However the industry is changing and load testing should adjust to these changes - a stereotypical, last-moment performance check is not enough anymore. There are multiple aspects of load testing - such as environment, load generation, testing approach, life-cycle integration, feedback and analysis - and none remains static. This presentation discusses how performance testing is adapting to industry trends to remain relevant and bring value to the table.},

abstract={CMOS image sensors rival CCDs in domains that include strong radiation resistance as well as simple drive signals, so it is widely applied in the high-energy radiation environment, such as space optical imaging application and video monitoring of nuclear power equipment. However, the silicon material of CMOS image sensors has the ionizing dose effect in the high-energy rays, and then the indicators of image sensors, such as signal noise ratio (SNR), non-uniformity (NU) and bad point (BP) are degraded because of the radiation. The radiation environment of test experiments was generated by the 60Co γ-rays source. The camera module based on image sensor CMV2000 from CMOSIS Inc. was chosen as the research object. The ray dose used for the experiments was with a dose rate of 20krad/h. In the test experiences, the output signals of the pixels of image sensor were measured on the different total dose. The results of data analysis showed that with the accumulation of irradiation dose, SNR of image sensors decreased, NU of sensors was enhanced, and the number of BP increased. The indicators correction of image sensors was necessary, as it was the main factors to image quality. The image processing arithmetic was adopt to the data from the experiences in the work, which combined local threshold method with NU correction based on non-local means (NLM) method. The results from image processing showed that image correction can effectively inhibit the BP, improve the SNR, and reduce the NU. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={A variety of testing tools has been developed to support and automate the software testing activity. Some of them may use different techniques such as Model-based Testing (MBT) or Capture and Replay (CR). Model-based Testing is a technique for automatic generation of testing artifacts based on software models. One of the main benefits of using MBT is related to the easiness of maintaining models over code; hence, it is likely that using models as a source for automatic generation of scripts requires less effort and reduces the number of faults. Otherwise, CR-based tools basically record the user interaction with the System Under Test (SUT) and then playback the recorded test. This paper presents our effort on setting up and running an experimental study performed in order to evaluate the effort to use MBT and CR-based tools to generate performance scripts. Thus, we apply an MBT and a CR approaches for the purpose of evaluation with respect to the effort to generate scripts and scenarios from the perspective of the performance testers and the performance test engineers in the context of undergraduates, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students, performance testers and performance test engineers for the generation of performance test scripts and scenarios. Our results indicate that, for simple testing tasks, the effort of using a CR-based tool was lower than using an MBT tool, but as the complexity or size of the activities of the testing tasks increases, the advantage of using MBT increased significantly. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Tasks in real-time embedded systems (RTES) are often subject to hard deadlines that constrain how quickly the system must react to external inputs. These inputs and their timing vary in a large domain depending on the environment state and can never be fully predicted prior to system execution. Therefore, approaches for stress testing must be developed to uncover possible deadline misses of tasks for different input arrival times. In this article, we describe stress-test case generation as a search problem over the space of task arrival times. Specifically, we search for worst-case scenarios maximizing deadline misses, where each scenario characterizes a test case. In order to scale our search to large industrial-size problems, we combine two state-of-the-art search strategies, namely, genetic algorithms (GA) and constraint programming (CP). Our experimental results show that, in comparison with GA and CP in isolation, GA+CP achieves nearly the same effectiveness as CP and the same efficiency and solution diversity as GA, thus combining the advantages of the two strategies. In light of these results, we conclude that a combined GA+CP approach to stress testing is more likely to scale to large and complex systems. 2015 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={In this paper, we propose the towards virtualized and automated software performance test architecture. In general, test engineers use the public performance testwares such as Load Runner, Silk Performer to validate the performance efficiency of their own systems. In case that they do not allowed to use the performance testwares due to the technical limitations in the testwares, most testers should perform the testing in manually. According to the waste of computer and human resources resulted from the situation, we need to propose the test automation scheme by using the virtualization technology to prevent the dissipation in the test environment which has limited resources. The system architecture considered efficient usage of computer resources and test automation to reduce human acts are addressed mainly in this paper. we describe our proposed method which deals with the system architecture and test automation procedures. In our system architecture, we will show how to use the virtual machines and the types of the virtual machines for performance measurement. In addition, the six steps of the test automation are introduced for the automated testing procedures. Finally, a number of experiments show that the proposed schemes allow offering the possibility for automated software performance testing by using the virtualization. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The goal is to support performance testing of touch screen devices and applications in a realistic test environment. To achieve this, the tests are based on real-world generated user profiles and executed using a real physical robot, simulating the actual user. Our performance testing targets different attributes of performance such as response times, power and resource usage, and software/hardware aging. Use of different hardware and software configurations in the test scenarios is considered.

abstract={Link-time optimization (LTO) is an increasingly important and adopted modern optimization technology. It is currently supported by many production compilers, including GCC, LLVM, and Microsoft Visual C/C++. Despite its complexity, but because it is more recent, LTO is relatively less tested compared to the more mature, traditional optimizations. To evaluate and help improve the quality of LTO, we present the first extensive effort to stress-test the LTO components of GCC and LLVM, the two most widely-used production C compilers. In 11 months, we have discovered and reported 37 bugs (12 in GCC; 25 in LLVM). Developers have confirmed 21 of our bugs, and fixed 11 of them. Our core technique is differential testing and realized in the tool Proteus. We leverage existing compiler testing tools (Csmith and Orion) to generate single-file test programs and address two important challenges specific for LTO testing. First, to thoroughly exercise LTO, Proteus automatically transforms a single-file program into multiple compilation units and stochastically assigns each an optimization level. Second, for effective bug reporting, we develop a practical mechanism to reduce LTO bugs involving multiple files. Our results clearly demonstrate Proteus's utility; we plan to make ours a continuous effort in validating link-time optimizers. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Load testing is an important part of the performance engineering process. It remains the main way to ensure appropriate performance and reliability in production. It is important to see a bigger picture beyond stereotypical, last-moment load testing. There are multiple dimensions of load testing: environment, load generation, testing approach, life-cycle integration, feedback and analysis. This paper discusses these dimensions and how load testing tools support them.},

abstract={The Indian River Inlet Bridge (IRIB), a 533-meter long cable stayed bridge, was opened for traffic in 2012. From the very early stages of the design process, the Center for Innovative Bridge Engineering (CiBRe) at the University of Delaware (UD) worked with the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) and their design-build team of Skanska and AECOM to plan and install a comprehensive structural health monitoring (SHM) system. This is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States. The system continuously monitors the long-term performance of the bridge during normal operation and short-term performance during controlled load tests and extreme events. The SHM system is a fiber-optic based design with more than 120 sensors of varying type distributed throughout the bridge. Data from the system is being integrated into the bridge maintenance and inspection records for the bridge and will facilitate DelDOT's ability to maintain and operate the bridge throughout its life. This paper provides an overview of the SHM system while focusing on results from four controlled load tests that have been conducted over the first two years of service. The tests have enabled the developement of a robust FE model and are being used to establish and track the performance of the bridge from its initial "baseline" response. © 2015, International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure, ISHMII.

abstract={Resilient Smart Grids require very robust communication infrastructures, which allow to support the control of the Smart Grid even and especially in critical situations. Current network quality assurance processes, such as drive tests in wireless systems, typically focus on cell coverage and quality of service parameters (e.g., max. data rate) at a specific geographical position, without considering the impact of overload situations. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology for stress testing a communication infrastructure for Smart Grids by synchronized, distributed so-called Smart Traffic Generators (STGs). Due to their low cost, the STGs become a permanent part of the infrastructure and enable a network operator independent, continuous network quality monitoring. A case study leveraging a LTE deployment demonstrates how the proposed approach can prove the fulfillment of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of time critical Smart Grid applications, even in stress situations with high cell load. Although, the proposed approach has been introduced for Smart Grids, it can also be used for ensuring the communication resilience for other critical infrastructures, e.g., public safety networks. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Business strategies are intended to guide a company across the mine fields of competitive markets through the fulfilment of strategic objectives. The design of a business strategy generally considers a SWOT operating context consisting of inherent Strengths (S) and Weaknesses (W) of a company, as well as external Opportunities (O) and potential Threats (T) that the company may be facing. Given an ever-changing and uncertain environment, it is important to continuously maintain an updated view of the operating context, in order to determine whether the current strategy is adequate. However, traditional SWOT analysis only provides support for the initial design of business strategy, as opposed to on-going analysis as new, unexpected factors appear and disappear. This paper proposes a systematic analysis for business strategy founded on models of strategic goals and stress test scenarios. Our proposal allows us to improve decision making by (i) supporting continuous scenario analysis based on current and future context and, (ii) identifying and comparing strategic alternatives and courses of action that would lead to better results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In recent technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) and Web 2.0, a critical problem arises with respect to storing and processing the large amount of collected data. In this paper we develop and evaluate distributed infrastructures for storing and processing large amount of such data. We present a distributed framework that supports customized deployment of a variety of indexing engines over million-node overlays. The proposed framework provides the appropriate integrated set of tools that allows applications processing large amount of data, to evaluate and test the performance of various application protocols for very large scale deployments (multi million nodes-billions of keys). The key aim is to provide the appropriate environment that contributes in taking decisions regarding the choice of the protocol in storage P2P systems for a variety of big data applications. Using lightweight and efficient collection mechanisms, our system enables real-time registration of multiple measures, integrating support for real-life parameters such as node failure models and recovery strategies. Experiments have been performed at the PlanetLab network and at a typical research laboratory in order to verify scalability and show maximum re-usability of our setup.

abstract={The world we live in now is defined by the word 'speed' and any device, technology, or system that doesn't keep up is rejected or replaced immediately. Because of this, one of the biggest concerns today is 'optimization'. Its purpose is to reduce the impact on the user's device. The Anti-Virus industry is also confronting with this challenge. Although the first concern is to keep the user safe, providing a flawless protection, it is crucial to reduce the impact brought on the user's system, preventing him to disable or uninstall the AV solution and thus remaining unprotected. The increased number of malware types/families as well as their complexity generated the need for complicated detection methods, which means a constant evaluation is needed. Because of these reasons, our antimalware laboratory has developed a generic framework for measuring the impact that the AV solutions have on the system they are installed on. This system was designed to be easily configurable, managing the big number of changes that occur every day and fast so that every update released to the users can be tested. Also, this framework is used to test and develop new technologies that improve the performance of our AV product. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Optimal surface transport asset management is a major concern with multiple economic and operational implications developed in various infrastructure areas. Although relevant 'mature' analytical frameworks have been proposed and developed, the problem setup and the algorithmic choices are still issues requiring thorough and detailed investigation. In this chapter, an optimal budget allocation framework is developed and stress-tested for the optimal scheduling of a bridges upgrading program. Asuitable test case is developed for performing in-depth analysis that takes into consideration the most important features involved in such scheduling problems, while alternative formulations are also presented and discussed. The proposed frameworks are applied on a real large-scale dataset from the highway system of US, able to provide an adequate test-bed for investigating the optimal upgrade problem. The paper aims in the investigation of the effects that alterations of the problem setup, but also the effects that algorithmic configurations are introducing, when addressing real-world applications. The binary/selection problem is handled with a suitably coded Branch-and-Bound (BaB) algorithm, which is regarded as a robust and fast heuristic for such optimization problems. BaB is tested in alternative standard and extreme configurations, offering insights on its performance. Interestingly enough, although the continuous relaxation introduced by the BaB enables fast convergence, the NP-hard problem's nature should be cautiously taken into consideration. The results are discussed in order to provide insights of applying the proposed framework in realistic infrastructure upgrading schemes. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Wireless vehicular communication is, in contrast to other terrestrial types of wireless communications, more dynamic in nature. Both the transmitter and the receiver are moving at high speeds relative to each other, which generates highly dynamic wireless channels. Such channels are characterized by short stationarity regions and large Doppler spreads. Modem manufacturers face a challenge when designing and implementing equipment for such environments. Similarly, for testing and evaluation real-life measurements with vehicles are required, which often is an expensive and slow process. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a method for stress testing transceivers based on the design and implementation of a real-time wireless channel emulator for wireless vehicular communications using a software defined radio (SDR). The emulator together with the proposed test methodology enable quick on-bench evaluation of wireless modems. In the paper we also apply the test on two different IEEE 802.11p modem implementations and characterize the packet error rate performance for different Doppler-delay combinations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={To overcome the positioning inaccuracy and discontinuity due to the signal errors and user dynamics in a wireless indoor navigation system, an adaptive Kalman filter positioning algorithm is proposed. This adaptive method automatically tune the elements in the process and measurement variance-covariance matrices according to the innovation values to enable a varying dependence on process or measurement model. The theory of the method is presented based on which the parameter settings are discussed. Both static and dynamic experiments under real indoor environment are conducted to verify the proposed method. Iterative least square (ILS) and standard Kalman filter (KF) are introduced to compare with the proposed adaptive filter. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the ILS and KF in both positioning accuracy and continuity.},

abstract={The inherent issues with handling large files and complex scenarios cause the data-driven approach [1] to be rarely used for performance tests. Volume and scalability testing of enterprise solutions typically requires custom-made test frameworks because of the complexity and uniqueness of data flow. The generation, transformation and transmission of large sets of data pose a unique challenge for testing a highly transactional back-end system like the IBM Sterling Order Management (OMS). This paper describes a test framework built on document-oriented NoSQL database, a design that helps validate the functionality and scalability of the solution simultaneously. This paper also describes various phases of planning, development, and testing of the OMS solution that was executed for a large retailer in Europe to test an extremely high online sales scenario. An out-of-the-box configuration of the OMS with the feature support for database sharding was used to drive scalability. The exercise was a success, and it is the world's largest IBM Sterling Order Management benchmark in terms of sales order volume, to date. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={To monitor the safety status of track, a wireless sensor network (WSN) system for track safety monitoring is developed. It consists of a data acquisition layer, a data management & analysis layer, and a monitoring portal/visualization layer. To keep the data integrity and the connection rapid response, a concurrent processing model of network tasks is proposed; to manage and analyze the continuous generated data, a data management & discovery model is constructed based on a MapReduce computations and a rule calculation engine. Finally, the WSN system with 104 nodes is set up at China Academy of Railway Science over 30 days. During the service time, several experiments are carried out to check the loss rate, the throughout, and the data latency. Besides, when a passenger train with an 80 Kg standard weight in each seat is passing by at a constant speed of 140 Km/s, the acceleration data of the ballastless slab tangent track, the ballast tangent track and the ballast curve track resulting from the wheel-rail interaction are obtained and the vibration characteristics (energy magnitudes, durations and instantaneous frequencies) are analysed by the wavelet transform (WT). The result shows that the data loss rates of 104 sensors are less than 5%; it can easily deal with the data with maximum arrival rate 0.52 MB/s without missing data; data latency from the acquisition completion to being displayed on the GUI is less than 1 min. Moreover, when the train is passing by at the constant speed, the acceleration data are processed by WT. For different structures, the energy in the medium frequency region is bigger than the others in the low and high frequency region. At 140 Km/h, the effect range of high frequency region is about 8 m, hence we can also detect the whole of wheel tread. The instantaneous frequencies of different structures can be obtained after getting the wavelet ridges. The instantaneous frequencies in medium and high frequency regions for slab tangent track are similar to the ones for ballast tangent track and suffer from less fluctuations than the ones for curve track. © 2015, International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure, ISHMII.

abstract={Workload generation is essential to systematically evaluate performance properties of application systems under controlled conditions, e.g., in load tests or benchmarks. The definition of workload specifications that represent the real workload as accurately as possible is one of the biggest challenges in this area. This paper presents our approach for the modeling and automatic extraction of probabilistic workload specifications for load testing session-based application systems. The approach, called Wessbas, comprises (i.) a domain-specific language (DSL) enabling layered modeling of workload specifications as well as support for (ii.) automatically extracting instances of the DSL from recorded sessions logs and (iii.) transforming instances of the DSL to workload specifications of existing load testing tools. During the extraction process, different groups of customers with similar navigational patterns are identified using clustering techniques. We developed corresponding tool support including a transformation to probabilistic test scripts for the Apache JMeter load testing tool. The evaluation of the proposed approach using the industry standard benchmark SPECjEnterprise2010 demonstrates its applicability and the representativeness of the extracted workloads. © Copyright 2015 ICST.},

abstract={Load testing in large service-oriented architecture (SOA) environments is especially challenging when services are under the control of different teams. It gets even more difficult if services need to be scaled before a load test starts. It is thus important to estimate workloads for services involved in a load test. Service workloads can be specified by the amount of service operation invocations distributed over time. We propose the use of performance models to derive this information for SOA-based applications before executing load tests. In a first step, we use these models to select usage scenarios. Afterwards, these models are transformed in a way that each scenario can be simulated separately from each other. These simulations can predict service workloads for selected usage scenarios and different user counts. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Running a load test is a time consuming undertaking for which normally a complete system should be configured. In contrast to running tests to find deviations from functional requirements, the goal of load testing is to find defects that only appear when the system has a lot of load to handle during a longer time. Load testing is typically performed by increasing the load and observing the effect of doing so. It is plausible that more defects can be detected by a wider variety of scenarios to create load. This makes it an attractive idea to use QuickCheck for the generation of user scenarios to perform load testing with randomly behaving users. In this paper we show that QuickCheck can be used as a framework for doing so by introducing and discussing load generators. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face continuously evolving field workloads in terms of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configurations. These evolving workloads often have a large impact on the performance of a ULS system. Hence, continuous load testing is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a load test closely resembles the current field workloads. Such validation may be performed by comparing execution logs from the load test and the field. However, the size and unstructured nature of execution logs makes such a comparison unfeasible without automated support. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to validate whether a load test resembles the field workload and, if not, determines how they differ by compare execution logs from a load test and the field. Performance analysts can then update their load test cases to eliminate such differences, hence creating more realistic load test cases. We perform three case studies on two large systems: one open-source system and one enterprise system. Our approach identifies differences between load tests and the field with a precision of ≥75% compared to only ≥16% for the state-of-the-practice.},

abstract={Performance modeling is an important step in the lifecycle of a typical Web-based multi-tier application. However, while most practitioners are comfortable carrying out load tests on a Web application on a testbed, they find sophisticated performance modeling tools difficult to use because many inputs required by them are difficult to obtain. Chief among these is the service times of various types of requests at various resources in the multi-tier system (e.g. CPU execution time required at the Web server by a \Login" request). In this paper, we present PerfCenterLite, a tool focused on ease of use for practitioners of performance analysis. The tool (a) provides a spread-sheet template for describing the application architecture and (b) accepts standard performance metrics obtained from load testing of the application. PerfCenterLite then uses mathematical estimation techniques and transforms this input into a full-edged performance model as required by a sophisticated performance modeling tool. Validation experiments show that performance metrics predicted using PerfCenterLite match well with measured values. © Copyright 2015 ICST.},

abstract={The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for conceptually describing data on the Web, and SPARQL is the query language for RDF. As RDF data continue to be published across heterogeneous domains and integrated at Web-scale such as in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, RDF data management systems are being exposed to queries that are far more diverse and workloads that are far more varied. The first contribution of our work is an indepth experimental analysis that shows existing SPARQL benchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries and varied workloads. To address these shortcomings, our second contribution is the Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) that provides stress testing tools for RDF data management systems. Using WatDiv, we have been able to reveal issues with existing systems that went unnoticed in evaluations using earlier benchmarks. Specifically, our experiments with five popular RDF data management systems show that they cannot deliver good performance uniformly across workloads. For some queries, there can be as much as five orders of magnitude difference between the query execution time of the fastest and the slowest system while the fastest system on one query may unexpectedly time out on another query. By performing a detailed analysis, we pinpoint these problems to specific types of queries and workloads. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

We focus on stress testing for heavy-weight network transactions. The computation power of MapReduce computing system is used to simulate concurrent network transactions issued by a lot of users. The user first describes the testing scenario which he wants to be simulate in a testing script. The TaaS platform analyzes the testing script and then automatically distributes required testing data including details of transactions and files into a MapReduce computing system. We propose three different schemes to distribute testing data and measure their performances. We compare them with the popular stress testing tool JMeter and find out that our scheme can always have the tested system deliver higher error rate during the stress testing. © 2014 IEEE.},

A performance testing framework is given, which simulates user behaviors in real environment based on virtual users so as to generate workload from the system under test (SUT). It can control the execution of virtual users by TTCN-3 standard interface. After executing the performance testing, test report is generated by extracting log. A method of generating performance test-case is studied by reusing functional test scripts.

Specifically, the identification of performance issues and their root causes are time-consuming and complex tasks which heavily rely on expertise. To simplify these tasks, many researchers have been developing tools with built-in expertise. However limitations exist in these tools, such as managing huge volumes of distributed data, that prevent their efficient usage for performance testing of highly distributed environments. To address these limitations, this paper presents an adaptive framework to automate the usage of expert systems in performance testing. Our validation assessed the accuracy of the framework and the time savings that it brings to testers. The results proved the benefits of the framework by achieving a significant decrease in the time invested in performance analysis and testing. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={[Context] A variety of testing tools have been developed to support and automate software performance testing activities. These tools may use different techniques, such as Model-Based Testing (MBT) or Capture and Replay (CR). [Goal] For software companies, it is important to evaluate such tools w.r.t. the effort required for creating test artifacts using them; despite its importance, there are few empirical studies comparing performance testing tools, specially tools developed with different approaches. [Method]We are conducting experimental studies to provide evidence about the required effort to use CR-based tools and MBT tools. In this paper, we present our first results, evaluating the effort (time spent) when using LoadRunner and Visual Studio CRbased tools, and the PLeTsPerf MBT tool to create performance test scripts and scenarios to test Web applications, in the context of a collaboration project between Software Engineering Research Center at PUCRS and a technological laboratory of a global IT company. [Results] Our results indicate that, for simple testing tasks, the effort of using a CR-based tool was lower than using an MBT tool, but as the testing complexity increases tasks, the advantage of using MBT grows significantly. [Conclusions] To conclude, we discuss the lessons we learned from the design, operation, and analysis of our empirical experiment. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

This paper aims on the investigations on the multi-chaos-driven evolutionary algorithm Differential Evolution (DE) concept. This paper is aimed at the embedding and alternating of set of two discrete dissipative chaotic systems in the form of chaos pseudo random number generators for the DE. In this paper the novel initial concept of DE/rand/1/bin strategy driven alternately by two chaotic maps (systems) is introduced. From the previous research, it follows that very promising results were obtained through the utilization of different chaotic maps, which have unique properties with connection to DE. The idea is then to connect these two different influences to the performance of DE into the one multi-chaotic concept. Repeated simulations were performed on the selected set of shifted benchmark functions in higher dimensions. Finally, the obtained results are compared with canonical DE. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Web performance testing, in short, is to simulate real user access workload and web system behaviour in test environment. Performance engineers often spent significant time to build and validate performance test workload model with their best effort and knowledge. The reality is that the workload models in performance testing often missed their real-world scenario targets due to missing "significant non critical" web usages or lack of accurate workload model validation. The accuracy of workload model is directly reflected back into the understanding of web app usage pattern in production. Without an accurate workload model, not only performance test results could be incorrect, but also many following tasks, performance bottleneck recreating, server performance tuning, capacity planning, and application framework validation could be at wrong targets. I will walk you through a practical way of building accurate workload model that will be matching to the targeted prod workload much closer comparing to the workload model created in current performance testing practice. The high accurate workload model and followed performance test results will bring high confidence on web app performance of new releases to project team.},

abstract={Web applications are increasingly resorting to public cloud platforms such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). However, previous studies have shown that the virtualized infrastructures used in a cloud environment can introduce performance issues. Hence, it is crucial to test the performance of the cloud to support Web applications. This is challenging because the performance effect of the cloud platform cannot be easily isolated from other extraneous factors. In this paper, we present a systematic experimental process to address this challenge. Following our proposed process, we test the performance of Web applications running on different types of AWS EC2 instances. Results suggest that Web server response times can fluctuate up to 1000% for the same workload under certain circumstances such as instance type, time-of-the-day, and day-of-the-week. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things, Smart Spaces and Geo-coding technologies are fastest growing directions in modern mobile market and urban environments [1, 2]. This is due to the advent of various services that using common technologies, as well as to develop common requirements and architectures for using geo-contextual services in semantic data processing. Location is a mandatory requirement for the Internet of Things and Smart Spaces directions products, because geo-context is a one of the factor to determine the location of subjects in various environments. As a result, it was decided to integrate geo-coding and smart spaces platforms, for the possibility of using geo-context in the semantic space. As an implementation used two open source software platforms - Geo2Tag and Smart-M3. The article discusses an integration agent performance testing and its analysis, provided recommendations for integration mechanisms optimization. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Due to performing complex and crucial tasks in industry, the control software should be created in a way ensuring possibly the highest quality. It can be increased by modeling, standardized implementation, and precise testing. The latter should verify not only functional requirements, but also nonfunctional, such as performance. In the paper, a concept of agile POU-oriented performance testing is proposed, which is dedicated to the IEC 61131-3 standard. The approach allows to measure and analyze execution times of particular Program Organization Units. The concept supports multiple target platforms and allows to take performance into account during early development stages, as well as to perform regression testing. The proposed process consists of a few stages, namely modeling (using SysML diagrams), implementation (in a dedicated test definition language), and execution (by a dedicated testing framework). The approach has been introduced into the CPDev engineering environment for programming industrial controllers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In modern dynamic construction fields, more attention has been paid on safely operating heavy construction equipment such as cranes, excavators, and concrete pump. In order to improve the safety in complicated jobsites, it is highly required to provide heavy equipment operators with accurate measurement of on-site objects in near real time. In this paper, a rapid surface modeling method and its performance evaluation through on-site tests are introduced. The performance of the proposed method was tested with a heavy equipment at construction site. The interrelationships among data size, processing time, and the size of the resultant hull segments were examined from the data analyses. The field experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic surface modeling method would significantly improve the equipment operation productivity and safety by distinguishing a dynamic surface model being controlled by the operator from the point cloud of existing static environment in 3D views.},

abstract={The Object Management Group's (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS) provides many configurable policies which determine end-to-end quality of service (QoS) of applications. It is challenging to predict the system's performance in terms of latencies, throughput, and resource usage because diverse combinations of QoS configurations influence QoS of applications in different ways. To overcome this problem, design-time formal methods have been applied with mixed success, but lack of sufficient accuracy in prediction, tool support, and understanding of formalism has prevented wider adoption of the formal techniques. A promising approach to address this challenge is to emulate system behavior and gather data on the QoS parameters of interest by experimentation. To realize this approach, which is preferred over formal methods due to their limitations in accurately predicting QoS, we have developed a model-based automatic performance testing framework with generative capabilities to reduce manual efforts in generating a large number of relevant QoS configurations that can be deployed and tested on a cloud platform. This paper describes our initial efforts in developing and using this technology. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, a wireless sensing system for structural field evaluation and rating of bridges is presented. The system uses a wireless platform integrated with traditional analogue sensors including strain gages and accelerometers along with the operating software. A wireless vehicle position indicator is developed using a tri-axial accelerometer node that is mounted on the test vehicle, and was used for identifying the moving truck position during load testing. The developed software is capable of calculating the theoretical bridge rating factors based on AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Rating specifications, and automatically produces the field adjustment factor through load testing data. The sensing system along with its application in bridge deck rating was successfully demonstrated on the Evansville Bridge in West Virginia. A finite element model was conducted for the test bridge, and was used to calculate the load distribution factors of the bridge deck after verifying its results using field data. A confirmation field test was conducted on the same bridge and its results varied by only 3% from the first test. The proposed wireless sensing system proved to be a reliable tool that overcomes multiple drawbacks of conventional wired sensing platforms designed for structural load evaluation of bridges.

abstract={Real-time, embedded software are constrained by several non-functional requirements, such as timing. With the ever increasing performance gap between the processor and the main memory, the performance of memory subsystems often pose a significant bottleneck in achieving the desired performance for a real-time, embedded software. Cache memory plays a key role in reducing the performance gap between a processor and main memory. Therefore, analyzing the cache behaviour of a program is critical for validating the performance of an embedded software. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate test inputs that expose the cache performance issues to the developer. Each such test scenario points to the specific parts of a program that exhibit anomalous cache behaviour along with a set of test inputs that lead to such undesirable cache behaviour. We build a framework that leverages the concepts of both static cache analysis and dynamic test generation to systematically compute the cache-performance stressing test inputs. Our framework computes a test-suite which does not contain any false positives. This means that each element in the test-suite points to a real cache performance issue. Moreover, our test generation framework provides an assurance of the test coverage via a well-formed coverage metric. We have implemented our entire framework using Chronos worst case execution time (WCET) analyzer and LLVM compiler infrastructure. Several experiments suggest that our test generation framework quickly converges towards generating cache-performance stressing test cases. We also show the application of our generated test-suite in design space exploration and cache performance optimization. © 2013 IEEE.},

After solving an issue, it may happen that the issue affects other components which results into a greater number of bugs. The resultant issues are called regression issues. The objective of this paper is to propose and implement a client-server, object-oriented, multiple plat form supporting frame work called RATS Framework which automates the process of regression and thereby helps debug engineers to solve time-consuming regression issues at a faster rate. It automates the process with the help of web-scrapping algorithm (W-S-A) that includes HTML/XML parsing to extract the needed content in the form of GUI-Web Objects, than using Network-Binary Search Algorithm (N/W-BS-A) and Change Finder Algorithm, a variant of Binary Search method, RATS finds out the nearest pass/fail driver build and change in the driver build that cause the new defect in the driver respectively. Because the RATS Framework does this at runtime, client-server approach has to be followed making use of Remote Identification and Installation-Algorithm. Hence RATS framework is a cost effective and time efficient approach for regression issues. The present article has the discussion of few of the patents relevant to automation testing software. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

It raises the interesting issue of converging these two kinds of tests by using the same formal approach. In this paper, we present a novel logic-based approach to test the protocol performance through real execution traces and formally specified properties.

abstract={Skewed-load tests ensure application of delay tests to logic cores of system-on-chip with only one storage element per cell in the wrapper boundary register and in the internal scan chain. This resolves the test area problem but the fault coverage and the test application time still require optimization efforts. The satisfiability-based test pattern generator of compressed skewed-load tests for transition delay fault is proposed. It represents a new efficient approach for generating compressed skewed-load tests because the test is gradually generated without the need of a pre-generated set of initialization and excitation vectors. Two optimization methods are also proposed. The first method, the wrapper cell ordering method, increases the fault coverage by reducing the shift dependence of skewed-load tests. The second method, the fault ordering method, ensures shorter tests by determining the order in which the faults will be targeted during the test generation and consequently, the new test vectors can overlap the test sequence in the greatest degree. The proposed methods were evaluated over benchmark circuits and the experimental results show higher fault coverages and shorter test lengths. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this work a methodology for LiDAR software performance testing is presented and six different suites are studied: QT Modeler, AutoCAD Civil 3D, Mars 7, Fledermaus, Carlson and TopoDOT (all of them in x64). Results depict as QTModeler, TopoDOT and AutoCAD Civil 3D allow the loading of large datasets, while Fledermaus, Mars7 and Carlson do not achieve these powerful performance. AutoCAD Civil 3D needs large loading time in comparison with the most powerful softwares such as QTModeler and TopoDOT. Carlson suite depicts the poorest results among all the softwares under study, where point clouds larger than 5 million points cannot be loaded and loading time is very large in comparison with the other suites even for the smaller datasets.

abstract={With advances in technology, interferometric radar is expanding the possibilities for monitoring vibrations and performing live load tests of bridges and other structures. This paper presents an instrument (IBIS-S) that utilizes interferometric radar to measure displacement as a function of time. Displacement of most structural elements in the line of sight can be measured to a precision of 0.01 mm at a sampling rate of 200 Hz in a noncontact manner. Traditional instruments used to monitor vibrations often require contact with the members, or noncontact measurements can only be done over a limited range. Further, traditional instruments can be time consuming to set up and costly to maintain. With interferometric radar technology, data typically are obtained in hours, and the monitoring is done from a remote point, precluding the need to access the structure or disrupt the use. It will be shown that the IBIS-S instrument can be deployed quickly, without interrupting the use of the structure, allowing the user to begin collecting vibration data under live loads within minutes. Included in this paper is a literature review of interferometric radar use on buildings, bridges, and wind turbines. Uses include fundamental frequency and mode shape determination of buildings, bridges, and other structures, as well as live load tests. Interferometric radar can be used successfully as part of a structural health monitoring program, wherein baseline vibration and displacement data are obtained and then the measurement process is repeated periodically. Depending on the structure type, changes in fundamental frequency or mode shape can reveal a loss of stiffness, which may be an indication of critical deterioration. Also discussed are the results of vibration monitoring for a cable-stayed pedestrian bridge. It will be shown that interferometric radar technology can be used to determine the global natural frequency of a cable-stayed bridge and the local natural frequency of individual elements (towers, cables, railing, etc.). Limitations of the technology are also discussed.},

abstract={Performance Testing of web-based applications in general is accomplished with the help of standard load testing tools and their methodology is well established and adopted by the Software Industry. With the advent of distributed Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) applications, load testing of services poses its own challenge to performance Testers and Engineers. In particular, this paper presents an approach and a tool by which the challenges for performance testing a messaging service (services using SOAP over MQ) can be overcome. Further, the paper illustrates how the existing tools can be adapted or new tools can be used to test them. In addition, it also specifies the testing, monitoring and tuning aspects of Messaging services.},

abstract={The Object Management Group's (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS) provides many configurable policies which determine end-to-end quality of service (QoS) delivered to the applications. It is challenging, however, to predict the application's performance in terms of latencies, throughput, and resource usage because diverse combinations of QoS configurations influence QoS of applications in different ways. To overcome this problem, design-time formal methods have been applied with mixed success, but a lack of sufficient accuracy in prediction, tool support, and understanding of formalism has prevented wider adoption of the formal techniques. A promising approach to address this challenge is to emulate application behavior and gather data on the QoS parameters of interest by experimentation. To realize this approach, we have developed a middleware framework that uses model-driven generative mechanisms to automate performance testing of a large number of DDS QoS configuration combinations that can be deployed and tested on a cloud platform.

abstract={Processor stress test utilities are important tools for a number of different use cases. In particular, cooling systems need to be tested at maximum load in order to ensure that they fulfill their specifications. Additionally, a test system characterization in terms of idle and maximum power consumption is often a prerequisite for energy efficiency research. This creates the need for a simple yet versatile tool that generates near-peak power consumption of compute nodes. While in different research areas tools such as LINPACK and Prime95 are commonly used, these tools are just highly optimized and compute intense routines that solve specific computational problems. As stress test utilities they are unnecessarily hard to use and in many cases unreliable in terms of power consumption maximization. We propose FIRESTARTER, an Open Source tool that is specifically designed to create near-peak power consumption. Our experiments show that this task cannot be achieved with generic high-level language code. We therefore use highly optimized assembly routines that take the specific properties of a given processor microarchitecture into account. A study on four compute nodes with current or last generation x86-64 processors shows that we reliably exceed the power consumption of other stress tests and create very steady power consumption patterns. © 2013 IEEE.},

The complete system was designed to operate by using one servo motor only. The system model was developed in SolidWorks and tested for different kinematic and dynamic performances. The performance of the gripper and cutting tool system has been evaluated through simulation to determine the design parameters of practical prototype. Based on the design concept, practical prototype of the gripper and cutting system was developed by considering the results obtained by model developed in SolidWorks. The developed prototype was tested to verify the feasibility and reliability of the model developed in Solid- Works. The performance and practical application of the developed prototype was verified and validated by conducting experiments in the lab and greenhouse and comparing the results with simulation results.},

abstract={Web application hosting in a data centre is clouded with quite a few issues ranging from hardware provisioning, software installation and maintaining the servers. Traditional data-centre techniques need production grade hardware to test application's behavior/performance under expected peak load. This could be costly and procuring hardware could be very time consuming causing delays in software delivery. Cloud (Infrastructure-as-a- Service) can be an answer to this. Cloud Computing provides production grade server instances at very cheap rates. This whitepaper is divided into two sub parts: first part details out the typical web application setup on Amazon Web Services cloud (AWS) [Ref 2], challenges faced during the setup and resolution for the same, while the second part talks about the observations made during load testing using Apache JMeter performance testing tool on AWS cloud. Three different application setup topologies (single tier, two tier and three tier) are tested and findings and learning from it are discussed here. This whitepaper only highlights the pitfalls encountered and possible resolutions for each and is not a comment on performance of Amazon cloud. The whitepaper endeavors to find out the best architecture which would give maximum return on investment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={This paper outlines an approach to support decision-makers in designing resilient critical infrastructure (CI) networks. As CIs have become increasingly interdependent disruptions can have far-reaching impacts. We focus on the vulnerability of CIs and the socio-economic systems, in which they are embedded, independent from any initial risk event. To determine which disruptions are the most severe and must be avoided, quantitative and qualitative assessments of a disruption's consequences and the perspectives of multiple stakeholders need to be integrated. To this end, we combine the results of consequence models and expert assessments into stress test scenarios, which are evaluated using multi-criteria decision analysis techniques. This approach enables dynamic adaption of the stress tests in the face of a fast changing environment and to take account of better information about interdependencies or changing preferences. This approach helps make trade-offs between costs for resilient CIs and potential losses of disruptions clearly apparent.},

It is expected that the functionality, the performance and the dependability are the same (or better) in the new version. Therefore, the preventive workload simulation (to verify non-functional properties) is crucial to guarantee the success of the modernization project. Since tools for load simulation work at protocol level, the automation of tasks for workload simulation demand much more effort than functional testing, whose test cases are designed using record and playback techniques on the GUI: these tools are more intuitive and they have to handle less variables and technical issues. In this article we present a tool to automatically generate workload simulation scripts from automated functional tests. The tool has been used in several projects in the industry, achieving important cost savings and improving flexibility when verifying non-functional properties of a migrated system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={With the ever increasing number of devices, nodes and the events they create, scalability and performance become important aspects for Operation Support Systems (OSS). One solution is to distribute the work load, i.e. ‘cloudify’ the formerly centralized monitoring and decision functions. This requires remodeling Complex Event Processing (monitoring) and Policies (decision making) towards a distributed yet coordinated system. This paper describes an extended architecture, implementation and performance tests for a policy-based event processing system. The main advantage of our approach is that we use policies for event pattern matching (an advanced form of Complex Event Processing) and for the selection of corrective actions (called Distributed Governance). Policies are (a) distributed (over multiple components) and (b) coordinated (using centralized authoring). The resulting system can deal with large numbers of incoming events, as is required in a telecommunication environment. Peak load will be well above 1 million events per second, combining different data sources of a mobile network. This paper presents the motivation for such a system, along with a comprehensive presentation of its design, implementation and evaluation. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.},

One of the often claimed drawbacks of Web applications is their low performance in conjunction with limited resources. We have created a benchmark framework to evaluate the performance of JavaScript in comparison to native code. The framework is designed to take the resource constraints of IVI systems into account. We conclude that general calculation tasks in JavaScript are on the average two to four times slower than native compiled counterparts on embedded vehicle hardware. The factor is independent from the allowed resource limits for each calculation. Using new features for Web applications (e.g. local storage functionality) or making frequent use of recursions there is a significant performance drop in JavaScript. In these cases native code runs up to 10 times faster than their counterparts in JavaScript. © 2012 IEEE.},

Sometimes it's because the test suite is too narrow but often it is due to the approach used to produce traffic and the way results are interpreted. This discussion focuses on the latter situation because a lack of testing scope is an obvious limitation but poor quality traffic and improper analysis techniques are subtle shortcomings that impact test credibility in ways that aren't always clear until the live application reveals them.},

abstract={Load testing of IT applications is fraught with the challenges of time to market, quality of results, high cost of commercial tools, and accurately representing production like scenarios. It would help IT projects to be able to test with a small number of users and extrapolate to scenarios with much larger number of users. This in turn will cut down cycle times and costs and allow for a variety of extrapolations closer to production. In this paper, we present a simple extrapolation technique based on statistical empirical modelling that analyses application workload based on its service demand on various system resources. The proposed strategy is also applied to predict the performance of mixture workloads before the system encounters any hardware resource bottleneck. The strategy is found to be more than 90% accurate for a range of applications running across a number of hardware servers. The technique has currently been validated for scenarios where the hardware is the bottleneck and is extensible to a wider range of scenarios as well.},

abstract={Sudden variations in current (large di/dt) can lead to significant power supply voltage droops and timing errors in modern microprocessors. Several papers discuss the complexity involved with developing test programs, also known as stress marks, to stress the system. Authors of these papers produced tools and methodologies to generate stress marks automatically using techniques such as integer linear programming or genetic algorithms. However, nearly all of the previous work took place in the context of single-core systems, and results were collected and analyzed using cycle-level simulators. In this paper, we measure and analyze di/dt issues on state-of-the-art multi-core x86 systems using real hardware rather than simulators. We build on an existing single-core stress mark generation tool to develop an Automated DI/dT stress mark generation framework, referred to as AUDIT, to generate di/dt stress marks quickly and effectively for multicore systems. We showcase AUDIT's capabilities to adjust to micro architectural and architectural changes. We also present a dithering algorithm to address thread alignment issues on multi-core processors. We compare standard benchmarks, existing di/dt stress marks, and AUDIT-generated stress marks executing on multi-threaded, multi-core systems with complex out-of-order pipelines. Finally, we show how stress analysis using simulators may lead to flawed insights about di/dt issues. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance Testing (both unit and system) is useful to understand application and sub-component(s) performance characteristics. System/Application performance testing gives insight into the overall performance of the application and is useful to debug performance issues before and during production phase. For High Performance Computing (HPC) applications, unit performance testing/proof-of-concept (POC) is very important to help choose from the different options (technology, design, data structures etc). For HPC applications, doing system performance testing becomes very complex as simulating very high input throughputs may necessitate construction of custom load injectors. Also, in HPC applications with complex workflows, simulating proper transaction mix and maintaining stable backend database size becomes complex. Monitoring different data points (latency, throughput) and debugging (log levels) is also tricky because of the overheads those incur. Unit performance testing of critical components involves complex workload and throughput modeling to determine achievable performance. This paper outlines two examples, one for POC through unit performance testing of a very high throughput application at architecture and design phase. The other is of system performance testing of a very high throughput application for SLA certification and tuning purpose.},

abstract={The objective of the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) is to study the performance of novel materials when subjected to the synergistic effects of the harsh space environment for several months. MISSE missions provide an opportunity for developing space qualifiable materials. Several laser and lidar components were sent by NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) as a part of the MISSE 7 mission. The MISSE 7 module was transported to the international space station (ISS) via STS 129 mission that was launched on Nov 16, 2009. Later, the MISSE 7 module was brought back to the earth via the STS 134 that landed on June 1, 2011. The MISSE 7 module that was subjected to exposure in space environment for more than one and a half year included fiber laser, solid-state laser gain materials, detectors, and semiconductor laser diode. Performance testing of these components is now progressing. In this paper, the current progress on post-flight performance testing of a high-speed photodetector and a balanced receiver is discussed. Preliminary findings show that detector characteristics did not undergo any significant degradation. © 2012 SPIE.},

abstract={The ASTRO-H Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) to cover hard X-rays up to 80 keV is thin-foil, multi-nested conical optics with depth-graded Pt/C multilayer. The reflectors are made of heat-formed aluminum substrate of the thickness gauged of 200 m of the alloy 5052, followed by epoxy replication on Pt/C-sputtered smooth Pyrex cylindrical mandrels to acquire the X-ray reflective surface. The epoxy layer is 20 m depth. In this paper, we report a thermal stress test of the reflectors of the HXT. The reflectors can experience in various temperature environment either in ground or in space. The temperature range can be as wide as several tens degrees in space dependently on the thermal design of the telescope system. We kept the reflectors in the three different temperatures at 5, 50 and 60 degrees, respectively, for a week. It is found that the surface of the reflectors at 60 degrees or higher temperature were significantly changed. The change appears as wrinkles with a typical scale length of a few tens micron meters. It is noticed that the scale length is equivalent to the depth of the epoxy layer, suggesting the existence of the epoxy layer causes the change in the scale length. No changes on the surface were observed from the 5 and 50 degree samples. No change on X-ray reflectivity was also detected from them. © 2012 SPIE.},

abstract={Performance test plays a fundamental and irreplaceable role in the field of software test, especially in guaranteeing the quality and reliability of an operating system. The performance of the process scheduling subsystem directly affects the accuracy and stability of the whole operating system. Linux operating system vendors execute performance test almost in every period of the Linux operating system research and development to enhance their products' competitiveness. However, the lack of methods and tools for the Linux process scheduling performance test has caused great difficulties for Linux operating system vendors to evaluate and tune the Linux kernel performance. Therefore, in order to solve the issues mentioned above, this paper, based on the analysis of Linux process scheduling mechanism, proposes a Linux process scheduling performance test method, implements a Linux process scheduling performance test tool as well, and finally validates the tool experimentally. © 2012 IEEE.},

Radio communication based train control system uses the standard of IEEE 802.11 which uses an unlicensed frequency band because there is no dedicated frequency for railways. Since there is the risk where the frequency interference and other interference problems can be occurred because the unlicensed band might be used by various wireless devices, we analyzed wireless environments of Daebul Line which was selected as the test section, and in this paper, we measured the performance of radio communication device to be applied to the radio communication network and selected a optimized location which has no shaded area. © 2012 AICIT.},

abstract={Mobile phones and mobile applications have now become an integral part of our everyday life. Mobile application testing plays a pivotal role in making the mobile applications more reliable and defect free. Existing test automation tools have been tailored to perform mobile test automation through mobile emulators. Other tools require the mobile device where the application is installed, to be connected to a computer so that the tests can be run. Obviously, the results obtained from emulators often differ from those obtained on actual mobile devices. To our best knowledge only a few solutions for creating automated tests of mobile applications exist and their functionality is very limited. In this paper, we introduce the idea of implementing a mobile test automation framework MobTAF which performs mobile test automation on the mobile device where connection to a computer is not required. The framework moves the testing infrastructure to the phone, to support test situations that cannot easily be replicated with an emulator. A prototype application was then implemented to test the mobile automation framework, MobTAF. The results prove that MobTAF framework is an efficient way of performing mobile application tests directly on the mobile devices. © 2012 IEEE.},

A static HTML webpage is put under load test for 1, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 concurrent users performed by the three tools. The findings clearly showed that different performance testing tool gave different response time when conducting load testing on same webpage.

We develop a conceptual model specifying the generic abstractions required for analyzing CPU usage and provide a mapping between these abstractions and UML/MARTE. Using this model, we formulate CPU usage analysis as a constraint optimization problem and provide an implementation of our approach in a state-of-the-art optimization tool. We report an application of our approach to a case study from the maritime and energy domain.

abstract={Owing to the growth of population, thus increased land scarcity for normal surface road construct and improper city council planning it inflict more tunnel and underground structure constructed. As most of the constructed underground structures are subjected to severe adverse condition which need thorough inspection. To maintain the good inhabitable tunnel structure ground penetrating radar (GPR) always use as a measuring tools. GPR as an inspection tools in tunnel has been plague with series of setback. In this case a new type of antenna has been introduced in order to improve the performance in tunnel inspection. An emphasize part of the antenna design must be ensuring the directivity, bandwidth characteristic, radiation efficiency and the penetration depth. This research has been divided into three cases and those cases were performed in order to signify the characteristic of the antenna. Laboratory test and numerical simulation were carried out for the comparison and urged to the optimize solution. In this paper, Agilent E5060A ENA has been used for the laboratory test to examine the performance of the antenna. The FDTD method for numerical simulation is to prove the authenticity of the result of laboratory test. The test result illustrates that; the new designed antenna is suitable for tunnel inspection. The important improvement should be further carried out. Further studies must investigate the application of this type of antenna for the inspection of tunnel lining. ©2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that revolutionizes the computing landscape by providing on-demand delivery of software, platform, and infrastructure over the Internet. Yet, architecting, deploying, and configuring enterprise applications to run well on modern clouds remains a challenge due to associated complexities and non-trivial implications. The natural and presumably unbiased approach to these questions is thorough testing before moving applications to production settings. However, thorough testing of enterprise applications on modern clouds is cumbersome and error-prone due to a large number of relevant scenarios and difficulties in testing process. We address some of these challenges through Expertus - -a flexible code generation framework for automated performance testing of distributed applications in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Expertus uses a multi-pass compiler approach and leverages template-driven code generation to modularly incorporate different software applications on IaaS clouds. Expertus automatically handles complex configuration dependencies of software applications and significantly reduces human errors associated with manual approaches for software configuration and testing. To date, Expertus has been used to study three distributed applications on five IaaS clouds with over 10,000 different hardware, software, and virtualization configurations. The flexibility and extensibility of Expertus and our own experience on using it shows that new clouds, applications, and software packages can easily be incorporated. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last few years, several IP network mobility proposals have come to light. Nevertheless, as none of these solutions has been deployed, the respective studies on functional characteristics, performance, scalability and signalling load are mostly limited to simple proof-of-concept studies, in reduced-size lab settings and/or simulated environments, with low or modest traffic loads. This paper presents a comparative study of three network mobility solutions - one of them proposed by the authors - with which it is intended to evaluate their behaviour under heavy load traffic. The study resorts to a network mobility emulator developed by the authors. After performing an extensive set of tests, based on the obtained results we are able to conclude that the proposed network mobility solution has clear performance advantages over other, more traditional solutions, regardless the number of mobile nodes, packet inter-arrival times, number of nesting levels, and percentage of route-optimised flows. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays the large-scale systems are common-place in any kind of applications. The popularity of the web created a new environment in which the applications need to be highly scalable due to the data tsunami generated by a huge load of requests (i.e., connections and business operations). In this context, the main question is to validate how far the web applications can deal with the load generated by the clients. Load testing is a technique to analyze the behavior of the system under test upon normal and heavy load conditions. In this work we present a peer-to-peer load testing approach to isolate bottleneck problems related to centralized testing drivers and to scale up the load. Our approach was tested in a DBMS as study case and presents satisfactory results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Before placing a software system into production, it is necessary to guarantee it provides users with a certain level of Quality-of-Service. Intensive performance testing is then necessary to achieve such a level and the tests require an isolated computing environment. Virtualization can therefore play an important role for saving energy costs by reducing the number of servers required to run performance tests and for allowing performance isolation when executing multiple tests in the same computing infrastructure. Load generation is an important component in performance testing as it simulates users interacting with the target application. This paper presents our experience in using a virtualized environment for load generation aimed at performance testing. We measured several performance metrics and varied system load, number of virtual machines per physical resource, and the CPU pinning schema for comparison of virtual and physical machines. The two main findings from our experiments are that physical machines produced steadier and faster response times under heavy load and that the pinning schema is an important aspect when setting up a virtualized environment for load generation. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Load tests aim to validate whether system performance is acceptable under peak conditions. Existing test generation techniques induce load by increasing the size or rate of the input. Ignoring the particular input values, however, may lead to test suites that grossly mischaracterize a system's performance. To address this limitation we introduce a mixed symbolic execution based approach that is unique in how it 1) favors program paths associated with a performance measure of interest, 2) operates in an iterative-deepening beam-search fashion to discard paths that are unlikely to lead to high-load tests, and 3) generates a test suite of a given size and level of diversity. An assessment of the approach shows it generates test suites that induce program response times and memory consumption several times worse than the compared alternatives, it scales to large and complex inputs, and it exposes a diversity of resource consuming program behavior. © 2011 IEEE.},

Magnetic field of the motor was obtained by finite element simulation and testing, and the output characteristic were studied. The calculated results of magnetic field using the finite element software ANSYS meet the experimental results, and the results show that magnetic flux density achieved 626 mT at the air-gap is 6 mm. Experimental system for testing output characteristics of the moving coil motor was established. Output characteristics testing of moving coil linear motor was conducted. The results show that effective output voltage increases linearly with displacement at constant magnetic field strength, coil length and moving frequency. The slope is the function of coil impedance and external load. Moreover, the output voltage increases at load resistance under conditions of same input voltage at a constant coil displacement. The calculatied natrual frequency is 16.5 Hz. The output current of the motor decreases with the increasing of work frequency away from the system natural frequency, and the efficiency of the system is 20%.},

abstract={Software testing process has a high cost when compared to the other stages of software development. Automation of software testing through reuse of software artifacts (e.g. models) is a good alternative for mitigating these costs and making the process much more efficient and efficacious. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is a technique to automatic generation of testing artifacts based on software models. For software development, the most spread modeling language in either the industrial or academic environments is UML. In such environments, it is desirable to reuse UML models also for MBT. avoiding re-building a different model exclusively for testing automation. These are the main reasons that make these semi-formal models an alternative to implementing MBT. Even though there are a lot of testing tools available commercially, to the best of our knowledge, none of them fully uses MBT. Therefore, this paper describes a case study showing how to implement the MBT process to automate test scripts generation and execution in a real-world, context. Furthermore, our solution is generated automatically by a Software Product Line (SPL).},

abstract={Nowadays testing plays an important role in software development process. While software testing is expensive and time-consuming, sufficient testing is hard, especially for a distributed system using web services technique in the real circumstance. The development of cloud computing provides us new ideas to solve these testing problems. To address these issues, we propose a framework which integrates cloud computing and performance testing technologies. In this paper, first we present the architecture of the cloud-based performance testing system for web services (CPTS), which is a portable, extensible and easy-to-use framework for generating and submitting test workloads to computing clouds. Then, we show the process how to use CPTS to run a performance test and present the concept of dynamic migration in CPTS. Finally, we present our experiences with CPTS in Amazon EC2. We found that the CPTS allows a user to easily set up and test a web services system on the cloud and improve test effectively. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the biggest challenges today with Pre-silicon System-on-Chip verification is to stress out the SoC to uncover as many corner case design issues by injecting heavy real time data traffic into the system. The inherent efficiency and the performance of the Emulation and FPGA prototyping systems make them the ideal platforms to run these tests. A typical solution is to inject data traffic through protocol exercisers with proprietary hardware (vendor specific slow down solutions) which can bridge the emulated DUT with a real time device or use software API's with transaction based SCE-MI communication infrastructure. The need for a complex input output interface makes the former difficult to be used with all emulators / FPGA prototyping systems while SCE-MI communication infrastructure being protocol specific is a disadvantage. So, a synthesizable verification architecture compliant with SCE-MI 2.0 infrastructure through which the protocol specific traffic is injected through industry standard interfaces. i.e. PIPE (PCIe), UTMI (USB), MII (Ethernet) based on user configured stimuli has been designed and implemented. Being synthesizable, the verification environment can run in both emulation and prototyping platforms effectively stress testing the complete system. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents challenges faced in typical Asynchronous Systems Performance Testing (ASPT) and workaround solutions applied for them. An Enterprise Service Fulfillment (ESF) system consists of Business Gateways, Application Integrators Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems, Order Fulfillment Systems, Fault Resolution Systems and series of other back-end systems such as billing, revenue assurance, work order management, MIS etc. It uses web services, queue communications with high volumes of different business transactions. Stringent business Service Level Agreement (SLAs) (like individual component response times, throughputs, utilizations and End to End (E2E) response times), scaled down test environment and unavailability of back-end components in test environment poses some unique challenges during performance testing of asynchronous systems. This paper elaborates these challenges and presents suitable workaround solutions devised to handle asynchronous transactions for complete performance testing thus providing an assurance on the asynchronous SLAs before the business goes live.},

abstract={Real time monitoring of broadband performance parameters is critical for estimating the user experience of new broadband services like VoIP, IPTV, Gaming and Video. This information is of interest to service providers themselves for efficient network design and maintenance and government regulatory bodies for analyzing ISPs, regions and national benchmarking. A web-based system TRUEE (Tool for Real-time User Experience Estimation) is a distributed system that incorporates independent modules such as standalone measurement devices installed at customer premises, data centers, test servers and web-clients for remote monitoring and management of the system. The focus of this paper is to discuss the process of benchmarking three commercial embedded devices with PC as reference device representing an end user system for accessing broadband services. This work is part of the ongoing development process of TRUEE. This benchmarking process is of significant importance for making an informed decision on the suitability of an embedded device capable of providing desired accuracy and consistency in estimation of the broadband performance parameters. Based on literature review, online forum reviews and cost analysis three devices based on ARM viz. SheevaPlug, Texas Instrument's BeagleBoard-xM and Gumstix Overo are selected for benchmarking. Results show that Marvell's SheevaPlug outperforms the other two devices in accurately measuring the broadband parameters on its network interface. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of economy, environmental pollution has become one of the major problems in coastal areas and cities along the river. Real-time observation of the water quality along the river has been considered as an efficient way to control wastewater emission and manage environment of water quality. Traditional ways to observe ocean environment, including satellite telemetry, radar, investigation ship, ocean observation station and etc, are not applicable for water quality observation along river because of their high cost, Poor real-time, low accuracy and so on. Based on Wireless Sensor Networks, the study discussed in this paper proposes a new observation system using under-water multisensory information. After processing multisensory data of each sensor the system transmits it to hub node through wireless sensor networks, and then transmits it to land data center through GPRS wireless network. In order to check the basic performance of this system, the authors have completed the node positioning experiment based on GPS module and the communication experiment based on ZigBee.

abstract={The continuous trend to decrease the cost-per-function and to increase the quality of integrated circuits amplifies the test challenges. Overall low production cost can be achieved only by considering the test area overhead, the test application time and the test quality. The fulfillment of these requirements is possible by application of short tests, use of low-overhead design-for-testability methods/standards and targeting more realistic fault models. The satisfiability-based test pattern generator of compressed skewed-load tests for transition delay faults is proposed. The test application is possible to logic cores of system-on-chip even with only one storage element per cell in the wrapper boundary register and in the internal scan chain. Therefore, the test area is kept low while the testability of delay faults is ensured. The proposed method represents a new efficient approach for generating compressed skewed-load tests. The experimental results show significant test length reduction and increased fault coverage. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The sustained systems performance (SSP) test has been implemented on certain High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) HPC systems in order to quantitatively evaluate updates to system software, hardware repairs, job queuing policy modifications, and revisions to the job scheduler as necessary. The test employs codes used in the system acquisition cycle with proven migration capability to HPCMP HPC systems and non-empirical tests for numerical accuracy. Metrics such as compilation time, queue wait time, benchmark execution time, and total test throughput time are gathered and compared against metric data from previous tests to monitor the systems under test while minimizing impact to the users. Jobs failing to execute properly or in anomalously short or long times are investigated, and the results are reported to system administrators and center directors at each center for appropriate actions. During the past year, the SSP test has been instrumental in surfacing configuration issues with the PBS scheduler and performance issues on several HPC systems. Additionally, the frequency of the SSP test on systems procured in Technology Insertion 2009 (TI-09) and thereafter has increased, with attendant changes in the test cases comprising the test. The SSP test continues to play an important role in monitoring the quality of service delivering HPC to HPCMP users at the system, DoD Supercomputing Resource Center, and vendor levels. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Load testing of IT applications is fraught with the challenges of time to market, quality of results, high cost of commercial tools, and accurately representing production like scenarios. It would help IT projects to be able to test with a small number of users and extrapolate to scenarios with much larger number of users. This in turn will cut down cycle times and costs and allow for a variety of extrapolations closer to production. We present a simple extrapolation technique based on statistical empirical modeling, which we have found to be more than 90% accurate across a range of applications running across a number of hardware servers. The technique has currently been validated for scenarios where the hardware is the bottleneck and is extensible to a wider range of scenarios as well. © 2011 Society for Modeling & Simu.},

abstract={Recently, considerable researches on wireless networks have been carried in industrial automation. A great deal of wireless control and monitoring systems are introduced in certain problematic parts of the process industry to improve the productivity and efficiency. However, the control and monitor application requires high standard performances, such as reliability, real-timing and accuracy. Therefore a comprehensive performance assessment is needed to test the property of the wireless network so as to optimize the network protocol and improve the network communication quality. This paper studies the wireless network in the integrated wired/wireless fieldbus system and proposes a method to acquire a set of key indicators of wireless networks. Then, a test device is designed to acquire the performance indicators of the system. The wireless protocols are analysed according to the performance indicators. The results show that the test for the performance of wireless networks can be realized by the method mentioned. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to test the overall credit risk of loans of China's banking system, a macroeconomic credit risk model is designed, including a multiple linear regression model describing default probability, and a set of regression models describing macroeconomic environment. Studies show that bank loan default rates and key macroeconomic factors are related. Then stress tests are implemented one by one according to different shocks. The results showed that most banks continue to profit even at 95% confidence level when estimated risk of loss, reflecting a moderate credit risk in the banking system. However, if confidence level rises to 99% when estimated risk of loss, the banking system will face significant losses. The results show that it is necessary to prevent the credit risk of real estate loans and government debt. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The information systems are becoming more and more complex and it is very common these days where database sizes are in hundreds of GBs. Handling of such large data volumes is creating challenges for assuring the performance of end-user applications. Applications involving database transactions are worst hit as there is no clue about the time required to fetch the relevant data from the huge database. The tools available in the market and the existing methodologies are suitable for the production environment but not effective in the development environment. This creates a gap between database application development and its deployment in the production environment. Therefore assuring the performance against high volume is an indisputable problem faced by the application developer and tester. In this paper, we discuss the work done in industry to tackle the SQL performance problem arising because of large data volumes and present SQL-PASS (SQL Performance Assurance Services), a web based service developed by TCS innovation Lab - Performance engineering, which helps to validate the SQL performance against high volumes without using actual data. We will also discuss how this service has been used in the development project to assure the performance. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={To reach high surface integrity and high processing efficiency simultaneously in abrasive machining process, a novel abrasive machining method employing the semi-fixed abrasive tool (SFAT) is developed. To provide an effective supplementary mean for experiments and decrease the costs of experiments in the design of the SFAT, simulation works for the performance tests of the SFAT, based on Particle Flow Method, are discussed in this paper. Setup of particle flow code (PFC) model of the SFAT is introduced. A series of virtual performance tests for SFAT including compacting process, shear test, and indentation test are carried out. To verify the effectiveness of the virtual test, real experiments are also done under the same conditions in virtual experiments. In both virtual and real experiments, SFATs made of 1000# abrasive grits are taken as the samples. The results obtained in virtual experiments are compared with these obtained in real experiments. The experimental results show that although the virtual results are not in perfect agreement with the real experimental ones, the virtual results give out the same trend and regularity of the experimental ones and the inaccuracy is acceptable for performance test. It indicates that the simulation model based on particle flow method for performance test of SFAT is feasible to be used as supplementary mean and reduce the cost of real experiments in SFAT design with further studies. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the economy, environmental pollution has become one of the major problems in coastal areas and in cities along rivers. Real-time observations of the water quality along rivers have been considered to be an efficient way to control wastewater emission and manage environmental water quality. Traditional ways to observe the ocean environment, including satellite telemetry, radar, investigation ships, ocean observation stations, etc., are not applicable for water-quality observations along rivers because of their high cost, poor real-time information, low accuracy, and so on. Based on wireless sensor networks (WSN), the study reported here proposes a new observation system using underwater multisensory information. After processing the multisensory data from each sensor, the system transmits it to a hub node through WSN, and then transmits it to a land data center through a general packet radio service (GPRS) wireless network. In order to check the basic performance of this system, we completed a node positioning experiment based on a GPS module, and a communication experiment based on ZigBee. This article reports the design of the hardware and the experimental results. © ISAROB 2011.},

Compared to a plain MPSOIW, it has the following outstanding features: (1) Decentralization in multi-swarm exploration with hybrid search, (2) Concentration in evaluation and behavior control with diversive curiosity, (3) Practical use of the results of evolutionary PSOIW, and (4) Their effective combination. This achievement expands the applied object of cooperative PSO with the multi-swarm's decision-making. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, computer experiments on a suite of multidimensional benchmark problems are carried out. We examine the intrinsic characteristics of the proposal, and compare the search performance with other methods. The obtained experimental results clearly indicate that the search performance of the MPSOIWα/DC is superior to that by the EPSOIW, PSOIW, OPSO, RGA/E, and MPSOα/DC for the given benchmark problems.},

abstract={Responding to more demand in coming years, the task of the small wind energy industry requires progress on several fronts - from public policy initiatives, to technology development, to market growth. Enhanced technologies such as contra-rotating blades, transmission systems, lubrication, airfoils, generators, and power electronics will lower cost and increase energy production. This paper mainly considers two key technological points of a small wind energy converter (SWEC) namely, the performance of the rotor system and induction generator. Small-scale prototypes have been built to experimentally verify the performance of the SWEC. Wind tunnel tests of the power output, power coefficient, and turbine speed were carried out to ascertain the aerodynamic power conversion and the operation capability at lower wind speeds. The results demonstrated a significant increase in performance compared to a single-rotor system of the same type. Another aspect of development and test is to present a comparative performance evaluation between a standard induction generator and an efficient but with modified design (TRIAS Generator) as a realistic solution of clean power for grid-connected SWECs. The paper also discusses issues related to control and monitoring of SWEC. © 2011 IEEE.},

One of the most frequent problems facing companies wishing to adopt this technology is selecting the most appropriate machine tool for the product in question and own enterprise characteristics. This paper presents a decision support system for high speed milling machine tool selection based on machine characteristics and performance tests. Profile machining tests are designed and conducted in participating machining centers. The decision support system is based on product dimension accuracy, process parameters such as feed rate and interpolation scheme used by CNC and machine characteristics such as machine accuracy and cost. Experimental data for process error and cycle operation time are obtained from profile machining tests with different geometrical feature zones that are often used in manufacturing of discrete parts or die/moulds. All those input parameters have direct impact on productivity and manufacturing cost. Artificial neural network models are utilized for decision support system with reasonable prediction capability. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2009.},

abstract={In the aftermath of the recent financial tsunami, the newly released Basel III Accord has demanded Scenario-based Stress Testing for banks. However, scenario generation is currently a bottleneck due to great heterogeneity in banking practices and organizational structures, leading to a research gap confronting IT professionals. To this end, we devise a way to treat financial scenario selection as a set-covering problem found in the field of approximation algorithms. Another ingenuity of our approach is to offering a high-level framework in order to accommodate individual bank variations, which we call as a meta-model approach. In addition, we propose a decision-support framework for scenario-based stress testing.},

abstract={A significant body of prior work has devised approaches for automating the functional testing of interactive applications. However, little work exists for automatically testing their performance. Performance testing imposes additional requirements upon GUI test automation tools: the tools have to be able to replay complex interactive sessions, and they have to avoid perturbing the application's performance. We study the feasibility of using five Java GUI capture and replay tools for GUI performance test automation. Besides confirming the severity of the previously known GUI element identification problem, we also describe a related problem, the temporal synchronization problem, which is of increasing importance for GUI applications that use timer-driven activity. We find that most of the tools we study have severe limitations when used for recording and replaying realistic sessions of real-world Java applications and that all of them suffer from the temporal synchronization problem. However, we find that the most reliable tool, Pounder, causes only limited perturbation and thus can be used to automate performance testing. Based on an investigation of Pounder's approach, we further improve its robustness and reduce its perturbation. Finally, we demonstrate in a set of case studies that the conclusions about perceptible performance drawn from manual tests still hold when using automated tests driven by Pounder. Besides the significance of our findings to GUI performance testing, the results are also relevant to capture and replay-based functional GUI test automation approaches. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The IEEE 1588 standard is widely established and accepted for clock synchronization in Ethernet networks. High accuracy IEEE 1588 implementations require a well-coordinated hardware/software co-design. Processing of sophisticated control algorithms for the time speed of local clocks within synchronization slaves are particularly important. Hence, IEEE 1588 implementations should be tested with respect to certain performance indicators like control loop behavior and synchronization accuracy. Furthermore, interoperability with other devices and standard compliance also need to be considered. The achievable synchronization accuracy depends on environmental conditions, network load and network topology. A test system should be able to emulate these physical conditions. This requires a well-founded knowledge about influences on IEEE 1588 implementations caused by both, environmental conditions and network load. This could be a frequency drift of crystal caused by either temperature variations or mechanical stress. Unfortunately, the standard does not specify an expected behavior in such an environment. Due to lack of standardization and test methods, a system-wide guarantee for synchronization accuracy can only be given for proprietary closed systems. In this paper a reproducible test environment with the ability to emulate environmental conditions is presented, followed by an evaluation of two exemplary implementations. The possibility to guarantee synchronization accuracy with the help of appropriate certification tests in such a specific test environment will be demonstrated. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Simply having a large beta test cannot consistently provide stability and performance to game servers, which are major issues in online game development. Therefore, test automations have been used in order to reduce the testing time of online games by simulating highly repetitive tasks and emulating server loads. However, in previous approaches, blackbox testing and scenario-based testing are not supported because they use prerecorded packets of real players as templates, or reuse a subset of the main game client for the test client. In this paper, we propose blackbox testing and scenario-based testing of online games as well as simple load testing. Instead of rewriting the virtual client dummy code, only the game description language and virtual game map are redefined when a new game is to be tested. In addition, an actual testing environment can be mimicked more closely, because complex and various scenarios such as attack, party play, and waypoint movement can be tested through combining actions. We have applied our tools on several online games to verify the effectiveness of our method. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={High speed IP communication is a killer application for 3rd generation (3G) mobile systems. Thus 3G network operators should perform extensive tests to check whether expected end-to-end performances are provided to customers under various environments. An important objective of such tests is to check whether network nodes fulfill requirements to durations of processing packets because a long duration of such processing causes performance degradation. This requires testers (persons who do tests) to precisely know how long a packet is hold by various network nodes. Without any tool's help, this task is time-consuming and error prone. Thus we propose a multi-point packet header analysis tool which extracts and records packet headers with synchronized timestamps at multiple observation points. Such recorded packet headers enable testers to calculate such holding durations. The notable feature of this tool is that it is implemented on off-the shelf hardware platforms, i.e., lap-top personal computers. The key challenges of the implementation are precise clock synchronization without any special hardware and a sophisticated header extraction algorithm without any drop. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

Hence, the safety assurance of the vital software running on the train control system is very critical task and yet, not many works have been done. While much efforts have been reported to improve electronic hardware's safety, not so much systematic approaches to evaluate software's safety. In this paper, we suggested an automated tool for performance testing in train control system, and presented its result of implementation. The testing items in the implemented tool had referred to the international standards in relation to the software for train control system, such as IEC 61508 and IEC 62279. In these international standards, 'performance testing' for train control system S/W has to be recommended highly. ©ICROS.},

abstract={The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) is currently the most commonly used psychosocial stressor to generate a response of the axes involved in stress. The TSST has proven effective in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition, new technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), are being integrated into stress research protocols (Kelly et al., 2007). To determine whether TSST as applied to VR leads to the sympathetic and neuroendocrine activation in a group of healthy individuals. Also, this study aims to connect this response with different psychological variables regarding stress vulnerability, psychopathology, and personality. Twenty-one university students (6 male and 15 female) were exposed to a modified version of the TSST adapted to a virtual environment (VE), in which they have to deliver a speech. Electrodermal activity and salivary cortisol secretion were simultaneously registered at different instances. After the task, sympathetic activation was observed in all participants, as well as increase in the cortisol secretion in 14 of the students. This increase was statistically significant in the moment prior to the speech and the moment after in the responder group. In the same fashion, statistically significant differences were found in the responder group only regarding obsession and compulsion scales and extroversion, which were higher in the responder group. Our findings support the use of the TSST paradigm in VR as an experimental situation appropriate to research designs in laboratory aiming to study the modulation of the axes implied in response to stress. © Virtual Reality Medical Institute.},

In order to obtain the NS result approaching the reality, in this paper, we analyze the structure of split-object mode and find reasons to cause the error. According to the definition of NS performance's index, we remodel the split-object model by choosing the proper function and equation in the control theory and deducing the logical coefficent in them. We further evaluate the efficiency and the availability of the new model under NS-2 platform.

This paper proposes a comparatively simple technique on the parallel implement of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). The transformation of the sequential objective evaluation in the MOPSO is based on the Matlab parallel computing tool box. Two study cases of different complexity demonstrate that the parallel implementation resulted in a considerable time saving. The deviation of computational time indicates that MOPSO has the characteristic of randomness because of the crowding distance and the dominant ranking. The proposed parallel MOPSO therefore, provides an ideal means to solve global optimization problems that are comparatively with high complexity. © 2010 IEEE.},

The existed tools for load testing usually generate virtual users with randomly choosing user sessions, manually generating user sessions or mining Log files, which causing such problems as non-real workload, subjectivity or difficult to update. Therefore we set each virtual user with a corresponding configure file, and these files determine the visiting paths, visiting moments and stay time of virtual users based on the Continuous Time Markov Chain. So we firstly finish the pretreatment for Log files, then construct the user visiting model, and next generate the virtual users, lastly carry out the load testing.

abstract={A correlation between the gated-diode R-G current and the performance degradation of SOI n-channel MOS transistor after F-N stress test has been demonstrated in this paper. Due to increase of interface traps after F-N stress test, the generation-recombination (R-G) current of the gated-diode in the SOI-MOSFET architecture increases while the performance characteristics of MOSFET transistor such as the saturation drain current and sub-threshold slope generate degradation. From a series of experimental measurements of the gated-diode and the SOI-MOSFET DC characteristics, a linear decrease of the drain saturation current and increase of the threshold voltage as well as the like-line rise of the sub-threshold swing and the corresponding degradation of the trans-conductance are also observed. These results provide theoretical and experimental evidences for us to use the gated-diode tool to monitor SOI-MOSFET degradation.},

abstract={In order to deliver quality assured software and avoid potential costs caused by unstable software, software testing is essential in software lifecycle. Load testing is one of the testing types with high importance. It is usually accompanied by performance monitoring of the hosting environment. In the case of web applications which are today widely used, one fact is obvious: most of web applications are public and used by vast number of users, which are making a considerable traffic load on hosting environments and web applications. Load testing and performance monitoring become facilitated with existing tools aimed for load testing and performance monitoring. In the paper we analyze and compare several existing tools which facilitate load testing and performance monitoring, in order to find the most appropriate tools by criteria such as ease of use, supported features, and license. Selected tools were put in action in the real environment, through several web applications. For the case study one of the web applications is used in order to introduce different capabilities of tools, including distributed testing, assembling of test scenario from previously recorded usage scenarios, security support, results analysis, monitoring of key parameters, and reporting and alerting about changes of these parameters.},

abstract={Interactive applications with graphical user interfaces are prevalent in today's environment: Everybody with access to any kind of computer constantly uses them. A significant body of prior work has devised approaches for automating the functional testing of such applications. However, no such work exists for automatically testing their performance. Performance testing imposes additional requirements upon GUI test automation tools: the tools have to be able to replay complex interactive sessions, and they have to avoid perturbing the application's performance. We study the feasibility of using five Java GUI capture & replay tools for GUI performance test automation. Besides confirming the severity of the previously known GUI element identification problem, we also identify a related problem, the temporal synchronization problem, which is of increasing importance for GUI applications that use timer-driven activity. We find that most of the tools we study have severe limitations when used for recording and replaying realistic sessions of real-world Java applications, and that all of them suffer from the temporal synchronization problem. However, we find that the most reliable tool, Pounder, causes only limited perturbation, and thus can be used to automate performance testing. Besides the significance of our findings to GUI performance testing, the results are also relevant to capture & replay-based functional GUI test automation approaches. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

During the load test, analyst strictly monitor and record thousands of performance counters to measure the run time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, network traffic etc. The most frustrating problem faced by analysts is the time spent and complexity involved in analysing these huge counter logs and finding relevant information distributed across thousands of counters. We present our methodology to help analysts by automatically identifying important performance counters for load test and comparing them across tests to find performance gain/loss. Further, our methodology help analysts to understand the root cause of a load test failure by finding previously solved problems in test repositories. A case study on load test data of a large enterprise application shows that our methodology can effectively guide performance analysts to identify and compare top performance counters across tests in limited time thereby archiving 88% counter data reduction. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied previously to UML-driven stress test requirements generation with the aim of increasing chances of discovering faults relating to network traffic in distributed real-time systems. However, since evolutionary algorithms are heuristic, their performance can vary across multiple executions, which may affect robustness and scalability. To address this, we present the design and technical detail of a UML-driven, GA-based stress test requirements generation tool, together with its empirical analysis. The main goal is to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness and also to validate the design choices of the GA used in the tool. Findings of the empirical evaluation reveal that the tool is robust and reasonably scalable when it is executed on large-scale experimental design models. The study also reveals the main bottlenecks and limitations of the tools, e.g., there is a performance bottleneck when the system under test has a large number of sequence diagrams which could be triggered independently from each other. In addition, issues specific to stress testing, e.g., the impact of variations in task arrival pattern types, reveal that the tool generally generates effective test requirements, although the features of those test requirements might be different in different runs (e.g., different stress times from the test start time might be chosen). While the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate software test cases has been widely reported, the extent, depth, and detail of the empirical findings presented in this paper are novel and suggest that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in generating stress test requirements. It is hoped that the findings of this empirical study will help other SBSE researchers with the empirical evaluation of their own techniques and tools. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Methods of pure performance testing or single analytical modeling, such as queueing network model, etc, have their limitation on the accuracy of performance indexes measurement, the validity of performance forecasting, and the controlling of testing iteration due to the complexity of Web systems. A Web performance modeling framework supporting mixed performance modeling is proposed. It uses different performance modeling methods for different kinds of performance indexes to derive closed form functions and their hypothesis of measurement. The regression analysis and testing are used on the training data to estimate the parameters of the closed form functions. To demonstrate the feasibility and validity of this framework, a real-world Web community system (igroot.com) is studied under the framework. For the indexes of system response time and scalability, a mixed modeling method is proposed by combining queueing network reduction and extended universal scalability model US-γ. Compared with other practical system performance testing methods, such as universal scalability model US, the model accuracy of performance forecasting is greatly improved and the cost of software and hardware used in the process is greatly reduced. The error rate of estimated response time is within 4 percent, the error rate of estimated throughout saturation point is within 1 percent, and the error rate of estimated infimum of buckle point is within 5 percent. Correlating the scalability model and threads data of the Web server, an HTTP processing bottleneck at the architecture level is identified.},

abstract={J2EE-based Web applications are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and with their increasing adoption, the performance is the attention focus and the most important factor of evaluating the system by users. In this paper, we present a systematic solution for performance testing and optimization of J2EE-based Web applications. The solution helps to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in the application design and ensures that systems are designed to meet their quality of service requirements. This paper firstly analyses the architecture of J2EE-based Web applications and performance testing principle, and then improves the JMeter testing framework for meeting the more concurrent users. Lastly, performance testing for J2EE-based Web applications is done; it finds performance bottlenecks and puts forward optimum measures, and compares the performance with the former one. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The current generation of distributed and automated physical location surveillance systems faces high demands for robustness and reliability. We present and evaluate the design of the Logical Decision Making Server (LDMS), a rule-based automated decision making component used in the Single Location Surveillance Point (SLSP) system. To validate the robustness of the LDMS design for operation in the SLSP environment, we design and conduct a stress test experiment in which large load of TCP/IP input messages is sent instantaneously to the LDMS prototype implementation using the Nethawk EAST software. The stress test results are compared to measurements obtained during a real-life scenario. The LDMS is observed to withstand a significant amount of load without crashing, and its performance is can be considered sufficient for the SLSP system needs. A detailed analysis of results however shows an increase in the latency resulting from an extreme temporal load. We identify potential areas in the design to be improved if demands for higher response rates arise. The research is based on the construction of the related publications and technologies, and the results are established from the testing and validation of the implemented LDMS within the SLSP system. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Pile load testing provides key information about pile design for a specific geological ground structure. These tests are required to guarantee that the piles will meet long term stability requirements for the foundation of the building. There are many types of sensor that can be used to monitor strain along the pile during pile load testing. The most commonly used sensor is the Vibrating Wire Strain Gauge (VWSG). Each VWSG has its own electrical cable which will have to withstand the concrete or grout pouring stage as well as the curing cycle. By the time the pile is ready for testing, a certain percentage of VWSG signals have often been lost. This paper presents a novel approach using Concrete Embeddable Fiber Optic Strain Gauges. One of the fiber optic based sensor advantage is to be able to daisy-chain the sensors. That is, reducing the number of cables along the pile. The optical cable can also be designed to withstand very harsh environments without adding too much to the cost of the sensors. This paper will also present comparative results as well as future possibilities to reduce cost and time for pile load testing.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of the wireless market and the development of various mobile devices, innovative methods and technologies to produce high-quality mobile applications and reduce time to market have been emerging. Mobile applications are often characterized by an array of limitations such as the short development lifecycle to gain a competitive advantage and difficulties to update once released. Hence, rigorous testing on the applications is required before distribution to the market, including structural white-box, functional black-box, integration and system testing. Although recently performance testing at the system test level has become crucial given its direct connection with the product quality improvement, most such tests are confined to the areas of load, usability, and stress testing. Moreover, the implementation itself is insufficient due to the limitations of the development environment. This paper proposes a method to support performance testing utilizing a database established through benchmark testing in emulator-based test environment at the unit test level. It also presents the tool that supports the proposed method of performance testing and verifies the reliability of performance test results through experiments. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance testing forms a fundamental part of any organization's software development lifecycle. Understanding large and complex application systems and then running end to end performance tests is of utmost importance, in order to avoid issues in production. Software systems are almost never perfect, but trying to avoid most of the basic issues/bugs before the application is deployed in production is a good practice. Running a test after choosing any one of the multitudes of free test tools available on the Internet or licensed tools is only a small part of the process. Even before you begin writing test scripts it is essential to understand the workload mix, the data flow, the components that make up the end to end system and the infrastructure available for testing. It is also necessary to assess the risks involved and come up with a mitigation plan. Once tests have been run and data collected it is also extremely vital to properly analyze data and present it, so that all stakeholders involved get a clear picture of the results. This paper will list out steps and guidelines that could be followed to successfully run performance tests. It will explain the criteria for creating good test plans, executing tests, analyzing the raw data and then presenting them in a manner that would be beneficial in understanding what and where if any, bottlenecks lie in the application. The paper will also present ways and tools that cold be employed to capture data during tests and how raw data could be analyzed and visually depicted to make it clear to the stakeholders viewing the test results.},

However, people should perform software performance testing manually in case of the situation that people cannot use testing tool. It needs a lot of resources such as human resource and computing resource. Therefore, we propose software performance testing scheme using virtualization technology to reduce resource consumption. Proposed scheme can reduce computer resource consumption because virtualization technology can make a number of virtual computers with a small number of physical computers. Also proposed scheme can reduce human resource consumption because, in proposed scheme, management computer can control keyboard and mouse of virtual computers automatically. Simulation result shows that proposed scheme has possibility to be used for software performance testing. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Ajax applications are designed to have high user interactivity and low user-perceived latency. Realtime dynamic web data such as news headlines, stock tickers, and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon as possible. However, Ajax still suffers from the limitations of the Web's request/response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real-time dynamic web data. Such applications usually use a pull style to obtain the latest updates, where the client actively requests the changes based on a predefined interval. It is possible to overcome this limitation by adopting a push style of interaction where the server broadcasts data when a change occurs on the server side. Both these options have their own trade-offs. This paper first introduces the characteristics of both pull and push approaches. It then presents the design and implementation of our distributed test framework, called Chiron, where different Ajax applications based on each approach can be automatically tested on. Finally, we present and discuss the results of our empirical study comparing different web-based data delivery approaches.© Rinton Press.},

Due to the fact that they have to endure a big number of concurrent requests, the performance of service applications running under specific arrival rate of requests should be assessed. To measure the performance of a service application, Multi-party testing context is needed to simulate a number of concurrent requests and collect the responses. TTCN-3 is a test description language; it provides basic language elements for multi-party testing context that can be used in performance tests. This paper proposes a general approach of using TTCN-3 in multiparty performance testing service application.

For the implementation of three-dimensional navigation using feature points, the presented system takes advantage of a robust image extraction and tracking algorithm, data association, and inertial SLAM filter algorithm. Finally, experimental results verified the performance of integrated navigation system, through which the performance enhancement in estimating relative position of the vehicle is demonstrated effectively. © 2009 SICE.},

abstract={The objective of any imaging system is to optimize the amount of pertinent information collected from a scene. Whether it is used for artistic reproduction, scientific research, or camouflage detection, a camera has the same ultimate requirement. In the era of broadband, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, and fused sensor systems, both spectral and spatial data continue to play battling roles in determining which is dominant in how well an imaging system meets its definitive objective. Typically sensor testing requires hardware and software exclusively designed for the spectral region of interest. Thus an imaging system with ultraviolet through infrared imaging capabilities could require three or more separate test benches for sensor characterization. Obviously this not only increases the complexity, and subsequently the cost of testing, but also more importantly tends to produce discontinuous results. This paper will outline the hardware and software developed by the authors that employ identical test methods and shared optics to complete infrared, visible, and ultraviolet sensor performance analysis. Challenges encompassing multiple emitting source switching, splitting, and combining will be addressed along with new single fused type source designs. Decisions related to specifying optics and targets of sufficient quality and construction to provide coverage of the full spectral region will be discussed along with sample performance specifications and data. Test methodology controlled by a single automated software suite will be summarized including modulation transfer function, signal to noise ratio, uniformity, focus, distortion, intrascene dynamic range, and sensitivity. Selected examples of results obtained by this test set will be presented. © 2009 SPIE.},

It provides automation of test case generation and test execution at unit test level.

Then, according to the relationship of the interfaces, a test-case-tree could be exported and finally the test cases were generated automatically. Consequently, a universal test framework was established and Rational Robot was used as automation test tool. A synchronization component was designed for the RTI automation test on multi-computers. Experiment proves that cross-examination works well and the automatic test can reduce the workload considerably.},

This scheduling mechanism computes a stream sequence in software and then the hardware schedules the stream according to this stream sequence. Experiments on a test system with a 10 Gb/s interface show that the mechanism provides good uniformity and equity, and can work in a full-load environment. The stream scheduling mechanism is independent of the number of streams and the test device interface speed, is suitable for any test system and has good extensibility.},

abstract={In previous work, the authors presented a theoretical lower bound on the required number of testing runs for performance testing of digital forensic tools. However, experimental errors are inevitable in laboratory settings, occurring as measurement errors or as random errors and can result in practical situations where the number of testing runs is far from the theoretical bound. This paper adapts our former work to tolerate such errors in the testing results. The contribution of our new methodology enables the tester to achieve performance testing results of high quality from a manageable number of observations and in a dynamic but controllable way. This is of particular interest to forensic testers who do not have access to sophisticated equipment and who can allocate only a small amount of time to testing. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Many software applications must provide services to hundreds or thousands of users concurrently. These applications must be load tested to ensure that they can function correctly under high load. Problems in load testing are due to problems in the load environment, the load generators, and the application under test. It is important to identify and address these problems to ensure that load testing results are correct and these problems are resolved. It is difficult to detect problems in a load test due to the large amount of data which must be examined. Current industrial practice mainly involves time-consuming manual checks which, for example, grep the logs of the application for error messages. In this paper, we present an approach which mines the execution logs of an application to uncover the dominant behavior (i.e., execution sequences) for the application and flags anomalies (i.e., deviations) from the dominant behavior. Using a case study of two open source and two large enterprise software applications, we show that our approach can automatically identify problems in a load test. Our approach flags < 0.01% of the log lines for closer analysis by domain experts. The flagged lines indicate load testing problems with a relatively small number of false alarms. Our approach scales well for large applications and is currently used daily in practice. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we are going to introduce the problem of assigning test components to hosts of a performance (or load) testing environment, and its two novel solutions. When testing the performance of a device (System Under Test - SUT), the test environment simulates the latter real-life environment of the SUT. The number of hosts in the test environment is however way less than the number of hosts the SUT will have to serve in its real-life environment. Thus, real-life hosts are simulated by software entities, the so-called test components that have to be optimally assigned and then executed on the hosts of the test environment (testing hosts). Our goal is to emulate all the test components by as few testing hosts as possible, that is, to maximize the load on the testing hosts. The problem to be solved is a special case of the task assignment problem for which many solutions have been developed. Our solutions presented in this paper are, however, optimized for distributing load testing traffic. Thus the possibilities and restrictions we had to take into account are very different from those of the classical task assignment case. One of the solutions we present extends existing bin packing heuristics, while the other one solves a series of integer linear programs to make the assignments. Our simulations have shown that by applying our solutions, the average load level on testing hosts can be significantly increased.},

abstract={Nowadays automatic testing is getting more and more important in the telecommunication world. The sooner a fault is discovered the cheaper it is to correct it. If a fault is discovered during the development process the cost of the correction is significantly smaller. There are different test strategies, with different approaches like, Conformance Test, System Test and Performance Test. The System Test takes place after a successful Conformance Test. Performance Test is analyzing the load characteristics of the System Under Test (SUT). In this article we describe the main attributes of performance testing, where the main challenge is to generate the expected load without having as complex hardware as the SUT is itself. Most of the papers, presented in this subject are focusing on the characteristics of the generated load, but not the way how to achieve it. These papers usually have the assumption that the load can be generated by deploying more hardware resources. Other papers propose new extensions for test description languages such SDL or TTCN-3 [4]. In this article we intend to describe a Finite State Machine (FSM) based model and an algorithm which improves the efficiency of Scheduling in this Performance Test environment. We present an architecture based on the so called Virtual Threads, an algorithm to optimize the scheduling between these threads, and an example to demonstrate the algorithm.},

abstract={The problem of optimizing accelerated production testing is a pressing one in most electronic manufacturing facilities. Yet, practical models are scarce in the literature, especially for testing high volumes of electronic circuit packs in failure-accelerating environments. In this paper, we develop both a log-linear and linear model, based initially on the Weibull distribution. The models developed are suitable for modeling accelerated production testing data from a temperature-cycled environment. The model is "piecewise" in that the failures in each discrete "piece" of the temperature cycle are modeled as if the testing was in parallel rather than sequential mode. An extra covariate is introduced to indicate age at the start of each piece. The failures in a piece then depend on the stress in the piece itself and the time elapsed to the start of the piece. This last dependence captures the influence of reliability growth and has the result of providing an alternative linear model to the log-linear one. The paper demonstrates a simpler use of Poisson regression. An application, using actual production data, is described. Uses of the Loglogistic, Logistic, Lognormal and Normal distributions are also illustrated. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Accelerated environmental stress tests (EST) are applied during the manufacturing process to improve reliability by precipitating and detecting latent defects. This test represents an in-process manufacturing screen and the objective of performing it is to avoid early field failures that reduce the customer satisfaction level and increase warranty and compensation costs. Temperature cycling during EST is one of the most commonly used test procedures. Although it is an expensive and energy intensive procedure, usually a lengthy test is initially recommended for a new product. Based on the product test performance or a possible manufacturing process modification, the test duration and regime may be changed after some period. Even if the number of test cycles is reduced, EST continues to be an expensive test and a major process bottleneck. This paper uses Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) to investigate the effects of the production and EST test variables on the population under test. Both the number of units rejected and the time to failure can be modeled as a regression function of covariates representative of the test environment. The field reliability function is written as a product of the unconditional reliability in each segment of the test profile such as dwell, ramp, etc. The next step is to apply the result of the temperature cycle EST GLM to a mathematical cost model. This cost model includes both the test cost and the warranty and compensation costs of the early field failures. The optimum test regime and number of cycles, which minimizes the total cost is determined by combining the GLM and the cost model. In this way the production test regime can be optimized in terms of field reliability/test cost trade-off. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={More and more softwares based on web service technologies are developed. Before their releases on the Internet, it is necessary to evaluate these systems' performance, especially their response time under different workload pressures. However, existing performance testing benchmarks and tools for web service applications are difficult to adapt to various user-specific testing purposes. This paper proposes a configurable web service performance testing framework which contains client module, application server module and database module. Client module, by using the network cooperation method that one central client drives several other clients, adapts to a great number of concurrent customers to request web services. Application server module contains web services under testing and external supporting web services, each of which is configured as a plug-in. The process to realize mixed ratio of web service interactions is similar to dealing cards and adapts to different commercial application characteristics. In database module, the data model including table and attribute dependence can be customized, and the data scale initialization can be resized according to the topology of above dependence. As such, this framework allows testers to dynamically define their data model, customize their scale of database, configure their transaction characteristics, deploy their application strategies and confirm their performance metrics. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach to performance testing, called Virtual Capture and Replay (VCR), that couples capture and replay techniques with the checkpointing capabilities provided by the latest visualization technologies. VCR enables software performance testers to automatically take a snapshot of a running system when certain critical conditions are verified, and to later replay the scenario that led to those conditions. Several in-depth analyses can be separately carried out in the laboratory just by rewinding the captured scenario and replaying it using different probes and analysis tools. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The virtual stress testing machine (VSTM) project demonstrates the use of the cyber-infrastructure to integrate the algorithms of computational mechanics and supplement virtual environments with physics. The VSTM is not a tool, nor is it intended to be; rather it is a pedagogical presentation of new research paradigms that should be comprehensible to mechanical engineers. VSTM encompasses a real stress testing machine, a virtual stress-testing machine, and a server that initiates and regulates all component physics and visualization processes the server also controls the real Instron. A series of benchmark tests were conducted for analysis of reliability and to demonstrate how such tests can and should be conducted so as to foster communication between mechanical engineers and their colleagues across disciplines. These tests have demonstrated the concept of creating a physics-based virtual environment by revealing both the accuracy and real-time functionality of the simulation. The tests also exposed some system vulnerabilities in network communication and remote memory access processes. VSTM provides a description for mechanical engineers, of the necessary core network technologies needed to solve mechanics problems in new ways and join the community of computer scientists already at work in this arena. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.},

abstract={The Grid middleware must be developed iteratively and incrementally, so Grid performance testing is critical for middleware developers of Grid system. Considering the special characters of Grid system, in order to gain meaningful and comprehensive results of performance testing, it is necessary to implement testing on real Grid environment with various types of workload. CROWNBench, as described in this paper, is a system for helping Grid middleware developers to evaluate middleware design and implement using customizable synthetic workload. Middleware developers can customize testing workload basing on the model of Grid workload derived from real workload traces, including its structure and parameters, and then workload is synthesized automatically and contained jobs will be submitted by CROWNBench in a distributed manner. CROWNBench defines several metrics for measuring Grid performance as automatic testing results. The experiment, which used CROWNBench to test the performance of Grid system with CROWN Grid middleware, shows that the system already finished have accomplished its prospective goal. It can implement Grid performance testing in an efficient, flexible, controllable, replayable and automatic way to help middleware developers evaluate and improve their products effectively. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Continuous integration is a software engineering process where an application under development is completely rebuilt and tested frequently and automatically. A continuous integration process is dependent on several factors including a single code repository, automated build process with self-testing, and continuous integration server. Continuous performance management implements performance and scalability testing within a continuous integration environment, which can perform integration and load testing.

abstract={The Galileo Test Range (GTR) project is an initiative of Regione Lazio in the frame of its support to the Italian technical research and innovation in satellite navigation. It is born as the Italian National permanent Laboratory for the experimentation and analysis of the Galileo Signal, for testing and certification of user terminals and support services for the development of application services. The development of the GTR is foreseen in two phases: - Phase A = Definition and Start up: implementation of the initial system, based on the generation on ground of navigation signals (GPS-like), using pseudolite technology (4 PSL), and to receive real signals coming from GPS, EGNOS and the new GIOVE-A Experimental Satellite. - Phase B = Full deployment and initialization of the GTR: implementation of the GTR final configuration, not only able to generate Galileo-like signals (from 9 PSL), but also to receive and process real signals coming from Galileo IOV satellites. The Phase A architecture is composed by the following macro segments: - The Analysis & Control Centre composed by the Control Centre (CC) and all the specialized laboratories (i.e. Time, Orbitography, Synchronization, Integrity, R&D); - The Experimental Area (covered by Differential Reference Stations) including the Test Area (covered by the Pseudolites - PSL) The 4 PSL deployed for the Phase A (2 fixed and 2 transportable) are equipped with the following main elements: • an atomic reference clock composed by an OCXO locked to Rb oscillator in order to obtain good short and long term stability; • a dual frequency GPS/SBAS Receiver Assembly; • a GPS-like signal generator • a directional antenna to disseminate the GPS-Like signal in the Test Area The PSL Receiver observables are sent to the GTR-CC and then to the Orbitography Laboratory Facility in charge of the Time Synchronization function of the GTR based on the SynchroNet product of TAS-I. The reference for this Synchronization is given by the Time Laboratory Facility, equipped with an Active Hydrogen Maser and 4 Caesium Clocks. The clock corrections are sent back to the PSL, uploaded in the Navigation Message and broadcasted to the Users in the Test Area. Users equipped with a GPS Receiver can connect it to a PC with a dedicated software (developed by TAS-I) that makes a data fusion between GPS satellites observables and PSL ones so as to compute a better 3D position. If required, the SW can compute a 2D solution using only the Pseudolite observables, Users can compute a 2D position. The PSLs guarantee in a flexible way, thanks to the transportable PSLs, an increased availability of GNSS-like signals in the Test Area that users can use to improve theirs navigation performances. The tests carried out show that the achievable performance in the Test Area with the 4 PSL of Phase A are in the order of 5 m in 3D and 3 m in 2D. With the upgrade foreseen in Phase B in number and type of signal, the performance achievable will improve and potential applications can be satisfied with the use of the PSL technology. The aims of this paper are to present the advantages of the availability of signals generated by PSLs (fixed and transportable) in a controlled area and to present the reached performances for the phase A of the GTR using PSLs. Furthermore it will be presented an overview on the potential applications for this technology that can be a good solution for all those environments that require augmentations in performance and availability (i.e. urban canyons, harbors, container movement, etc⋯).},

abstract={The use of static terrestrial laser scanning for the 3D data capturing of smaller scenes as well as airborne laser scanning from helicopters and fixed wing aircraft for data collection of large areas are well established tools. However, in spite of their general acceptance and wide use both methods have their limitations for projects that include the rapid and cost effective capturing of 3D data from larger street sections. This is especially true if these sections include tunnels or if dense point coverage of the facades of the neighbouring architecture is required. To extend the applicability of laser scanning to these kinds of projects, terrestrial cinematic laser scanning based on mobile mapping systems can be used. Within the paper the components, the workflow and the performance of the vehicle based "StreetMapper" system are described, which simultaneously uses four 2D-laser scanners for 3D data collection, while georeferencing is realised by a high performance GNSS/inertial navigation system. Within our investigations the accuracy of the measured 3D point clouds is determined using reference values from an existing 3D city model. As it will be demonstrated, the achievable accuracy levels of better than 30mm in good GPS conditions make the system practical for many applications in urban mapping.},

abstract={Following the agile philosophy that all core features of a system need an automated test harness, performance requirements also need such a check when they are essential for the success of a project. The purpose of this paper is to describe a tool, J3DPerfUnit, which supports automated performance testing for Java3D applications in agile environments. We elicited tool requirements from domain experts through a survey and evaluated J3DPerfUnit using code from our partner's bioinformatics project and Java3D official tutorials. The evaluation pointed out that the tool is effective in detecting performance problems and in identifying where they come from when loading/unloading a 3D object. © 2007 IEEE.},

However the literature on testing in the library environment is sparse. This study examines the operational efficiencies of a RFID library reader. The factors examined included angle directionality sensitivity, read distance and tag location. The findings suggested that the performance of the inventory system degrades significantly as the angle directionality moves from 0 to 60 degrees. The read distance varied from vendor specification.

abstract={Network storages are used widely in many fields of our society. But their testing performances are not as expected. Most of the tools being used to test the performance of network storage comes from the tools used to test the traditional storage system because the storage devices connected to the net act as the local storage devices. So these tools inevitably miss the effects exerted by the networks which connect the hosts to the storage devices. For example, these tools can hardly generate requests which exceed the maximum loading of storage devices. In this paper, we propose one new method to test the performance of network storage which can easily generate requests that exceed the maximum loading of storage devices. In this method, the test program sends the requests by fixed frequency and the initiator will not be restrained by the targeter when the quantity of requests is close to the maximum load. The load simulated by the new method is more like the load in the real world, especially when the load is very high. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={New versions of existing large-scale web services such as Passport.com©have to go through rigorous performance evaluations in order to ensure a high degree of availability. Performance testing (such as benchmarking, scalability, and capacity tests) of large-scale stateful systems in managed test environments has many different challenges, mainly related to the reproducibility of production conditions in live data centers. One of these challenges is creating a dataset in a test environment that mimics the actual dataset in production. Other challenges involve the characterization of load patterns in production based on log analysis and proper load simulation via reutilization of data from the existing dataset. The intent of this paper is to describe practical approaches to address some of the aforementioned challenges through the use of various novel techniques. For example, this paper discusses data sanitization, which is the alteration of large dataseis in a controlled manner to obfuscate sensitive information, preserving data integrity, relationships, and data equivalence classes. This paper also provides techniques for load pattern characterization via the application of Markov Chains to custom and generic logs, as well as general guidelines for the development of cache-based load simulation tools tailored for the performance evaluation of stateful systems. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={CONCEPTUAL is a toolset designed specifically to help measure the performance of high-speed interconnection networks such as those used in workstation clusters and parallel computers. It centers around a high-level, domain-specific language which makes it easy for a programmer to express, measure, and report the performance of complex communication patterns. The primary challenge in implementing a compiler for such a language is that the generated code must be extremely efficient so as not to misattribute overhead costs to the messaging library. At the same time, the language itself must not sacrifice expressiveness for compiler efficiency or there would be little point in using a high-level language for performance testing.This paper describes the CONCEPTUAL language and the CONCEPTUAL compiler's novel code-generation framework. The language provides primitives for a wide variety of idioms needed for performance testing and emphasizes a readable syntax. The core code-generation technique, based on unrolling CONCEPTUAL programs into sequences of communication events, is simple yet enables the efficient implementation of a variety of high-level constructs. The paper further explains how CONCEPTUAL implements time-bounded loops - even those which comprise blocking communication - in the absence of a timeout mechanism as this is a somewhat unique language/implementation feature. © 2007 IEEE.},

We also present a case study on the performance testing of password cracking tools, which allows us to confirm that the lower bound on the number of testing runs needed is closely related to the row size of certain orthogonal arrays.

abstract={The most common type of energy used is firewood. In some Sub Saharan countries, up to 90% of total energy use is from firewood. The consumption of wood fuel is in some countries as high as twice the sustainable yield, something that has led to environmental degradation due to deforestation and scarcity of firewood. The use of fossil fuels such as kerosene and LPG for cooking is expensive. Solar energy is a non-consumptive and non-polluting fuel. It can help alleviate the problem of insecurity of cooking energy, which is the major domestic energy requirement. Several attempts have been made to introduce solar cookers in different countries and have achieved variable successes. There are still critical issues yet to be resolved in order to make that technology acceptable for wider dissemination. They include getting the most appropriate types of solar cookers for specific locations, optimum size/capacity, types of materials to be used, optimal design and affordable cost. In an attempt to resolve these issues, a comprehensive study involving theoretical review, development work, experimental testing and evaluation of solar cookers was conducted for several years on six different types of solar cookers. The cookers are the 'SunStove' box cooker, wooden box cooker, panel cooker, reflector cooker with unpolished aluminium reflectors, reflector cooker with polished aluminium reflectors and reflector cooker with glass mirror reflectors. This paper presents the results of the study. Results obtained indicate that many of the cookers could be used to cook food for households in areas with medium and high insolation, with appropriate selection of the type and specification of the cookers. The specification should be based on the measured insolation data of the location indication of the direct and diffuse components. As a guiding tool, reflector cookers offer best comparative performance in areas with longest durations of clear sky (greatest direct beam), panel and collector cookers under moderate cloudy conditions and box cookers under very cloudy conditions.},

Experience with applying early performance testing in a TDD framework for a device-driver development project provides insight into the test-first approach. The results show a trend of performance improvement throughout the development life cycle, and better performance compared to an earlier release. Lessons learned include the benefit of having a performance architect on the development team and of tracking performance measurements throughout the development life cycle.This article is part of a special issue on test-driven development. © 2007 IEEE.},

The models can be constructed from sample data and can take into account effects of session history on user behaviour and the existence of different categories of users.

abstract={The American Competitiveness Institute (ACI) performed a series of Environmental Stress Tests for the Joint Group of Pollution Prevention / Joint Council of Aging Aircraft (JG-PP / JCAA) Lead Free Soldering Program. The objective was to determine if Lead Free soldered hardware was equivalent to or better than its Tin Lead (SnPb) counterpart. The program's test vehicle was manufactured by BAE Systems in Irvine, Texas. The JG-PP / JCAA test vehicle was soldered with Tin Lead (SnPb) as a baseline, Tin Silver Copper (95.5Sn3.9Ag0.6Cu or SAC), Tin Silver Copper Bismuth ((92.3Sn3.4Ag1.0Cu3.3Bi or SACB), and stabilized Tin Copper (99.3Sn0.7Cu0.05Ni). The Salt Atmosphere test was performed in accordance to ASTM B117 Test Method for 48 hours. The Temperature Humidity test followed the procedure MIL-STD 810F; Test Method 507.4. In both tests, no failures were found that could be attributed to the solder joints. Therefore, the Tin Lead and Lead Free soldered hardware can be considered equivalent. Two types of Mechanical Shock tests were performed. The first Mechanical Shock test was performed using the test procedure MIL-STD 810F; Method 516.5; Procedure 1. The test was performed on all 3 axes. 2 components soldered with SACB failed the tests. The balance of the SnPb and Lead Free soldered components passed this mechanical shock test with no failures. The second Mechanical Shock test was performed to a modified version of MIL-STD 810F; Method 516.5; Procedure 1, where the test vehicle was tested in the Z-Direction, at increasing levels to failure. The mechanical shock levels reached in this test were above those in the first mechanical shock test. Across all test levels and component types, the SnPb soldered hardware performed comparable or better than the SAC and the SACB soldered hardware.},

abstract={The growth of software applications in size and complexity is being followed by a number of specific nonfunctional requirements such as portability, interoperability, and availability on various platforms. Most often, these have been addressed by middleware or programming environment. In addition, easy customizability, adaptability, and sharing of components facilitates the development cycle. These should be understood and applied in a broader sense, i.e. to byproducts created during the development process such as programs for functional and performance testing. Much time is spent on developing test programs but their quality and quality of thus obtained results varies largely if the process is not standardized and automated. In this paper we present our experience with performance testing of a large scale suite of gateways that are used for the seamless integration of heterogeneous communication networks. We analyze the commercial and public domain tools for load generation and motivate our decision to define an in-house framework and build a distributed tool for performance, testing that is also not restricted by licensing issues and is readily available to everyone involved. Our tool is built on Visper, the object-oriented distributed programming middleware. The suitability and adaptability of the Visper model for rapid application development and the quality of produced result have proven our decision correct.},

abstract={As online services increasingly play vital roles in modern society, the possibilities and opportunities offered are limitless, unfortunately, so too are the risks and chances of malicious intrusions. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called Zero Administrative Server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a Virtual Machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Enterprise applications are often business critical but lack effective synthetic workload generation techniques to evaluate performance. These workloads are characterized by sessions of interdependent requests that often cause and exploit dynamically generated responses. Interrequest dependencies must be reflected in synthetic workloads for these systems to exercise application functions correctly. This poses significant challenges for automating the construction of representative synthetic workloads and manipulating workload characteristics for sensitivity analyses. This paper presents a technique to overcome these problems. Given request logs for a system under study, the technique automatically creates a synthetic workload that has specified characteristics and maintains the correct interrequest dependencies. The technique is demonstrated through a case study involving a TPC-W e-commerce system. Results show that incorrect performance results can be obtained by neglecting interrequest dependencies, thereby highlighting the value of our technique. The study also exploits our technique to investigate the impact of several workload characteristics on system performance. Results establish that high variability in the distributions of session length, session idle times, and request service times can cause increased contention among sessions, leading to poor system responsiveness. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for a session-based system. We believe our technique is of value for studies where fine control over workload is essential. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Bridge management officials have expressed a keen interest in the use of low-cost and easy-to-install wireless sensors to record bridge responses during short-term load testing. To illustrate the suitability of wireless sensors for short-term monitoring of highway bridges, a wireless monitoring system is installed upon the Grove Street Bridge to monitor structural responses during static and dynamic load testing. Specifically, load testing of the Grove Street Bridge is conducted after its construction to validate the behavior of a novel jointless bridge deck constructed from a high-performance fiber reinforced cementations composite (HPFRCC) material. A heterogeneous array of sensing transducers are installed in the bridge including metal foil strain gages, accelerometers and linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs). First, the acceleration response of the bridge is monitored by the wireless system during routine traffic loading. Modal parameters (modal frequencies and mode shapes) are calculated by the wireless sensors so that an analytical model of the bridge constructed in a standard commercial finite element package can be updated off-line. Next, the bridge is closed to traffic and trucks of known weight are parked on the bridge to induce static deformations. The installation strategy of the wireless monitoring system during static load testing is optimized to monitor the strain and rotation response of the HPFRCC deck. The measured static response of the deck is compared to that predicted by the updated analytical model.},

abstract={Reactive real-time systems have to react to external events within time constraints: Triggered tasks must execute within deadlines. It is therefore important for the designers of such systems to analyze the schedulability of tasks during the design process, as well as to test the system's response time to events in an effective manner once it is implemented. This article explores the use of genetic algorithms to provide automated support for both tasks. Our main objective is then to automate, based on the system task architecture, the derivation of test cases that maximize the chances of critical deadline misses within the system; we refer to this testing activity as stress testing. A second objective is to enable an early but realistic analysis of tasks' schedulability at design time. We have developed a specific solution based on genetic algorithms and implemented it in a tool. Case studies were run and results show that the tool (1) is effective at identifying test cases that will likely stress the system to such an extent that some tasks may miss deadlines, (2) can identify situations that were deemed to be schedulable based on standard schedulability analysis but that, nevertheless, exhibit deadline misses.},

FOTG processes an extended FSM model, and uses a mix of forward and backward search techniques. Unlike traditional verification approaches, instead of starting from initial states, FOTG starts from a fault and uses cause-effect relations for automatic topology synthesis then uses backward implication to generate tests. Using FOTG we test various mechanisms commonly employed by multicast routing, and validate our results through simulation. © 2005 IEEE.},

A complex data traffic environment can be emulated for performance testing by generating simultaneously a number of flows with various data characteristics. The data rate and the degree of bursting of the packets in each flow are important parameters that are specified by the flow model in this paper. Since many flows should be sent from each network interface, a scheduling mechanism is needed to maintain the flow model of each flow. This paper describes a scheduling algorithm that groups the flows and polls them in round robin in both the flow-level and the group-level. The algorithm can achieve the scheduling objective with low time and space complexity. The algorithm implemented in a high-speed network performance tester, IP-TEST achieved a line-speed of 1 Gb/s and supported burst flow models.},

abstract={Accelerated Stress Testing (AST) has been used in electronic, electromechanical, and mechanical systems to achieve robustness with high reliability primarily for hardware. For software products, the reliability program is often conducted separate from any hardware accelerated stress testing. Yet, many systems consist of concurrent software and hardware issues. In addition, the stress testing processes were primarily adopted by those responsible to develop and manufacture hardware. For example, the stresses usually include temperature extremes, thermal cycles, vibrations, etc. These stresses are effective in accelerating latent hardware defects from degradable, marginal, or intermittent failures to hard failures so that root cause analyses and corrective actions may be made. Although experiments had indicated that software faults and hardware defects are related, the available formulation of the fundamental principles was still based on hardware systems. AST for software and for operating systems have been discussed in [3] and [4], but a fundamental understanding of AST for software is lacking. In order to generalize the fundamentals of accelerated stress testing to address both software and hardware, we need to define accelerated stress testing for software and to address whether they are needed, i.e., whether there are effective methods to achieve high software reliability. The basic reliability concepts categorize systems into different categories according to the presence of defects and faults and whether these weaknesses are explicit enough. The concepts for both hardware and software reliability separate the notion of defects and faults from failures. It further conceptually separates the notion of stressing and the notion of detection. The fundamental concept is that all failures except the explicit ones must be manifested under certain stress conditions. There is then a threshold stress level beyond which a system will fail. The cumulative effect of stresses is included by defining time as one type of stress. Both hardware and software systems have marginal weakness, and degradable weakness. The process of recovery and repair are also examined for both hardware and software events. The basic reliability principles in accelerated stress testing for both software and hardware systems are combined and explained in this paper. While [3] and [4] also address the needs and advantages of AST for software, an effective software AST program will require efficient tools yet to be developed. The benefits should justify the needed further research and development in this area.},

abstract={As the next generation of Internet services requires more highly scalable and available server systems, the cost-effective cluster of a large number of distributed computers becomes a popular solution. In this paper, we investigate to design and develop a server load balancing mechanism on cluster architecture, called the ALBM cluster. In order to construct the more scalable and reliable Internet service system, the ALBM cluster system consists of independent but co-operable components. The ALBM cluster system supports adaptive load balancing among servers via its adaptive load balancer (ALB) component in Layer 4 level and Layer 7 level. The Management Station (M-Station) and the Administrator Console are in charge of cluster management, system configuration management, and performance counter management. The Node Service is a system-level agent that is deployed into a server node. The node management and cluster management are the major tasks of the agent. Beside, the ALBM cluster is a flexible open system whose features of functionality can change or be easily expanded without affecting the rest of the system. In this paper, we also present a set of our experimental results to compare the performance of the ALBM cluster with that of LVS scheduling cluster system. We compare performance results of the ALBM with RR, LC, and WLC scheduling algorithms of a LVS cluster in both of homogeneous and heterogeneous system environments. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In a data warehouse (DW) environment, when the operational environment does not posses or does not want to inform the data about the changes that occurred, controls have to be implemented to enable detection of these changes and to reflect them in the DW environment. The main scenarios are: i) the impossibility to instrument the DBMS (triggers, transaction log, stored procedures, replication, materialized views, old and new versions of data, etc) due to security policies, data property or performance issues; ii) the lack of instrumentation resources on the DBMS; iii) the use of legacy technologies such file systems or semi-structured data; iv) application proprietary databases and ERP systems. In another article [1]; we presented the development and implementation of a technique that was derived for the comparison of database snapshots, where we use signatures to mark and detect changes. The technique is simple and can be applied to all four scenarios above. To prove the efficiency of our technique, in this article we do comparative performance tests between these approaches. We performed two benchmarks: the first one using synthetic data and the second one using the real data from a case study in the data warehouse project developed for Rio Sul Airlines, a regional aviation company belonging to the Brazil-based Varig group. We also describe the main approaches to solve the detection of changes in data origin. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={The stability and robustness of routing protocol implementations (RPI) in a router are becoming more and more important with the growth of Internet scale. A novel approach named stress testing is proposed to test the properties of RPI. Compared with some traditional test techniques, stress testing is remarkably necessary to inspect and analyze RPI. The test environment is proposed and the test process of OSPF RPI is illustrated by a stochastic Petri Net model with large-scale route simulation and OSPF protocol emulation. Based on this model, the integrated performance tester (IP-TEST) is designed and developed, with which we test a CISCO2600 router. With mathematical methods, we find that the computational complexity of OSPF implementation in this router is O((lnN)4) to the number of its routing table entries. This experiment shows that this technique can inspect the stability, the computational complexity and the scalability of RPI. Furthermore, it can also be widely used with other routing protocols, such as RIP and BGP.},

abstract={With the advancement in network bandwidth and computing power, multimedia systems have become a popular means for information delivery. However, general principles of system testing cannot be directly applied to testing of multimedia systems on account of their stringent temporal and synchronization requirements. In particular, few studies have been made on the stress testing of multimedia systems with respect to their temporal requirements under resource saturation. Stress testing is important because erroneous behavior is most likely to occur under resource saturation. This paper presents an automatable method of test case generation for the stress testing of multimedia systems. It adapts constraint solving techniques to generate test cases that lead to potential resource saturation in a multimedia system. Coverage of the test cases is defined upon the reachability graph of a multimedia system. The proposed stress testing technique is supported by tools and has been successfully applied to a real-life commercial multimedia system. Although our technique focuses on the stress testing of multimedia systems, the underlying issues and concepts are applicable to other types of real-time systems.},

abstract={In stress test ECG analysis, the so-called ST/HR hysteresis has recently been suggested to improve coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis. This parameter is estimated from the ST versus HR diagram including exercise and recovery phases. Unluckily, ST measurements are adversely affected by noise during the test. In this study we propose a method to automatically estimate the ST/HR hysteresis, incorporating multiple stage noise attenuation. The method is based on averaging and rejection of noisy beats. Evaluation is done on simulated exercise test recordings, constructed from real ECG averaged beats adding actual noise from stress test records. Results on a total of 216 different records, with RMS noise levels ranging from 114 to 979 μV, give a reduction in estimation error in the ST/HR diagram of 77.98% (from 168 to 37 μV) in mean and of 76.38% (from 271 to 63 μV) in standard deviation. This method may be considered as a suitable and robust tool for reliable ST/HR hysteresis estimation.},

The Liquid Nitrogen cooled "Brutus" chamber at Ball Aerospace was the test facility. Flight-like self cooling, thermal blanketing, and auxiliary cooling loops allowed the assembly to reach temperatures close to orbital conditions. (25-5 K) Introducing optical sources at the SIRTF focal plane allowed the telescope to perform as the collimating source. A motorized and cryogenically characterized reflection flat was used to direct the refocused images of test sources to visible and IR focal planes in SIRTF's Multi-Instrument Chamber. A sequence of tests was performed to gather data on system focus position, image stability, telescope wavefront and instrument assembly confocality.},

abstract={During the development of high-performance processors, software performance models are used to obtain performance estimates. These models are not cycle-accurate, so their results can have significant errors, leading to performance surprises after the hardware is built. Some performance tests can run directly on the logic simulators, to get more accurate results, but those simulators cannot run large interactive workloads with I/O and much operating system code. So the accurate performance estimates from logic simulators are only available for application code, and are not adequate for the evaluation of powerful server systems that are primarily intended to run large interactive workloads. We discuss a software tool system, the "Reverse Tracer", that generates executable performance tests from an instruction trace of the workload. The generated performance tests retain the essential performance characteristics of multi-user I/O-intensive workloads without doing any real I/O, so they can run in logic simulation to measure performance accurately before the hardware is built. © 2002 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel scheme of synthesizing nonlinear feedback shift register structures that can be superimposed on the boundary of the component of a system under test to generate interconnect switching activities that resemble real life interconnect switching profiles is proposed. The goal is to perform at-speed interconnect test while simultaneously capturing the dynamic switching effects such as crosstalk and ground bounce, as accurately as possible during interconnect built-in self-test. A library of nonlinear feed-back shift register structures called precharacterized test pattern generators (P-TPGs) is constructed. Components of P-TPGs can be modeled using Markov chain and can be interconnected together in specific Ways to recreate the switching activity profile of the interconnections being tested. The unique advantage of this scheme is that there is no simulation overhead since P-TPG components are precharacterized by solving Markov equations analytically. An integrated genetic algorithm-based search and optimization technique for finding the best P-TPG component among various possible implementations and matching its activity profiles with those of the interconnections under test has been designed and implemented. P-TPG synthesis for testability allows generation of the worst case interconnect switching activities. Experimental results confirm the validity of our approach.},

abstract={Performance of many Web sites depends on the load on the site at peak time under varying conditions. Performance testing is normally conducted in reasonably simulated environment with the help of performance testing tools. However, performance of a Web site depends on various parameters and each parameter must be tested under varying stress levels. It is not possible to draw a common denominator for performance parameters to test the Web site due to complexity of Web sites. Different parts of the Web site must be tested with different parameters under varying condition and stress level. In such circumstances, it is necessary to decompose the Web site into many components, which represents the behavior of various business components. These business components are mapped to various objects that truly represent the behavior and structure of the part of the web site. These objects are subjected to performance testing with different parameters and stress levels. This paper addresses the new testing process, which uses the concept of decomposing the behavior of the Web site into testable components, which are mapped onto testable objects. These testable objects are subjected to performance testing under varied performance parameters and stress levels. © 2000 IEEE.},

abstract={System performance is often described in terms MIPS, MFLOPS, IO bus speed, etc. However, these dimensions are not very useful in characterizing overall system performance when part of the system is not silicon based (e.g., when there is a human user). Thus in wishing to address overall system performance in man-machine systems we must toss the user into the fray. How should this be done? Often, we just ask users how they like the particular configuration. We have, after all, been inculcated with the dictum, 'Honor thy user,' and it isn't far from that pronouncement to, 'The user knows best.' Thus if the user is happy we can expect optimal system performance. Or can we?

abstract={A fetal monitoring device developed for non-stress-test (NST) screening at home works on battery power, and is so small and lightweight (152 X 120 X 64 mm, 600 g) that a pregnant woman can monitor fetal Doppler ultrasound and record fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) data on an attached memory IC card at any time and in any place away from a hospital. The physician can evaluate these data, transmitted via public telephone lines, using a built-in modem in the monitor. The combination of the memory IC card as a temporary storage device with the intermittent data transmission to the host provides endless data storage. The input-output relationship of the device was quantitatively evaluated using a Doppler ultrasound heart rate simulator. Forty pregnant women participated in an evaluation of this system. The total number of NST data transmissions was 648, and the total amount of data received was more than 6.7 Mbytes. Of the 648 transmissions, 475 were adequate for clinical interpretation. Of the 101 failed NST data transmissions, 85 resulted from patient handling errors. However, 82.4% of these errors resulted in reexamination and transfer of new data by the patients, who were aware of the insufficiency of the original data. The main cause of noise in the data was zero-count data; this noise rate accounted for 4.1% of the data abnormalities. A questionnaire survey found that 96% of the participants wanted to use the monitor again in their next pregnancies, and 83% would recommend its use to pregnant friends. The system was easily used and accepted by pregnant women, and the NST data obtained were sufficient for clinical interpretation.

In fact, the whole `global' nature of many businesses today demand that lines of business function seamlessly across multiple time zones spanning difficult geographic areas. This places an increasing challenge on the personnel, resources and configurations required to support these business functions, hence, an understanding of the performance and availability characteristics of the I/O Subsystems capable of supporting such functions is essential. This paper details the results of an extensive suite of testing in a customer environment of EMC's Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) and IBM's Peer to Peer Remote Copy (PPRC). An initial review of the various modes of Operations and the full assessment of the functionality of each of the two offerings is made. As expected, to the extent that variations exist within and amongst customer environments, the results of this testing will require specific interpretation. The true benefit of this type of testing is the rather comprehensive and quantitative amount of information which becomes immediately applicable to the many situations facing performance analysts, capacity planners, storage management and other technical management personnel.},

Three-tier computing features a data server for stored databases (Tier 1), an application server that runs applications (Tier 2), and a simple client program that runs on desktop machines that presents the user interface (Tier 3). Three protocols are available to communicate between Tier 2 and 3: Intelligence Computer Architecture (ICA) with and without data compression, and X Window. We measured the performance of the three protocols in a multi-user environment in which we simulated the workload imposed by typical users. We found that, for Microsoft Office 97 and Lotus Notes applications, the X Window protocol uses approximately twice the network bandwidth of ICA, without compression. We also found that compressed ICA generates roughly one third less network traffic than uncompressed ICA at a cost of 20% of additional processor utilization.},

The purpose of this test was to validate the Acoustic Strain Gauge as being functionally equivalent to the resistance strain gauge, and to demonstrate a cost effective enabling technology to the civil and structural engineering communities. The diagnostic tests program was supervised by Dr. Abba Lichtenstein in accordance with accepted guidelines contained in the manual for "Rating Bridges Through Testing" For the purpose of this study the bridge superstructure was modeled and structural loading profiles were determined using both resistive and acoustic strain measurement techniques. Measured strains as determined by the ASG (correlation between the ASG and the resistance strain gauge was 0.998) were compared to theoretical loads in order to determine if the Rodeo Gulch superstructure was operating in a safe and reliable manner. Additionally, under the direction of Phil Fish (Wisconsin DOT), two pre-production ASGs were used to monitor accumulated cyclic loading.

abstract={Load sensitive faults cause a program to fail when it is executed under a heavy load or over a long period of time, but may have no detrimental effect under small loads or short executions. In addition to testing the functionality of these programs, testing how well they perform under stress is very important. Current approaches to stress, or load, testing treat the system as a black box, generating test data based on parameters specified by the tester within an operational profile. In this paper, we advocate a structural approach to load testing. There exist many structural testing methods; however, their main goal is generating test data for executing all statements, branches, definition-use pairs, or paths of a program at least once, without consideration for executing any particular path extensively.Our initial work has focused on the identification of potentially load sensitive modules based on a static analysis of the module's code, and then limiting the stress testing to the regions of the modules that could be the potential causes of the load sensitivity. This analysis will be incorporated into a testing tool for structural load testing which takes a program as input, and automatically determines whether that program needs to be load tested, and if so, automatically generates test data for structural load testing of the program. © 1996 ACM.},

abstract={To find out if ATM is really delivering on its promises, DATA COMM and European Network Laboratories put together the industry's first full-blown stress test for ATM switches. The main goal was to find out how ATM switches work under real conditions. Testers evaluated seven enterprise-class switches using a custom suite of benchmarks that measure latency and jitter, and determine how well each box contends with data bursts and protects delay-sensitive traffic.},

Although these techniques were specifically designed for testing telecommunications software, they can be used to generate test cases for any software system that is modelable by a Markov chain provided operational profile data can either be collected or estimated. These algorithms have been used successfully to perform load testing for several real industrial software systems. Experience generating test suites for five such systems is presented. Early experience with the algorithms indicate that they are highly effective at detecting subtle faults that would have been likely to be missed if load testing had been done in the more traditional way, using hand-crafted test cases. A domain-based reliability measure is applied to systems after the load testing algorithms have been used to generate test data. Data are presented for the same five industrial telecommunications systems in order to track the reliability as a function of the degree of system degradation experienced. © 1995 IEEE},

abstract={The load capacity of piles are routinely determined from full scale pile load tests under actual field conditions. Several empirical methods were proposed for the analysis of field load/settlement data based on personal inspection and graphical construction. Each of these methods is suited for a particular condition of pile, soil, and load-testing combination. Personal interpretation of the data and human judgement required by these methods may result in inaccurate or inconsistent predictions. The computer program TUTSTPIL was developed to automate the analysis of pile load tests data. It offers a standard and time saving tool that increases accuracy and reduces calculation errors. TUTSTPIL determines the pile capacity using a group of well established methods and provides statistical assessment of the analysis. The C programming language was used to develop TUTSTPIL on a MS-DOS type personal computer. Field data can be read directly from a load/settlement file, entered interactively from the keyboard via menu-driven screens, or digitized from a paper copy of the load/settlement curve. The first two options are suitable for a design office environment, whereas the third option is ideal for performing parametric studies and when numerical data is not available.},

abstract={We present an approach to application-level performance testing. This uses a popular test tool, TPNS (Teleprocessing Network Simulator) to simulate performance of an application. Our approach hinges upon a simple prototype to verify that the system performance falls within acceptable bounds. Once the initial prototype is developed, detailed tuning may take place. We present a case study in which we tested the performance of a large finance application. This approach led to critical performance tuning improvement. Due to this improvement, the average user response time in our simulations was reduced from 30 seconds to under 1.5 seconds. This simulation has been verified by actual system usage during the first two months of live operation in which the average response time has indeed been under 1.5 seconds.},

The workload presented in the paper is synthetic and does not represent any known workload deployed at any site. No endorsement of IBM of its products is expressed, and none should be implied. No recommendation is made regarding the purchase DB2 or any other IBM products. A network of 300 terminals was simulated using IBM's Teleprocessing Network Simulator (TPNS), and test scripts were executed at various transaction rates to measure the system performance under both peak and non-peak conditions. The basic workload was then restructured to take advantage of DB2 2.3's new package feature and additional volume testing was conducted. The reader of this paper is assumed to have a basic knowledge of DB2 principles and MVS performance terminology and concepts. The reader may wish to read the provided glossary before proceeding, or may reference it as needed.},

This paper presents simple procedures for assessing the performance of a cathode ray tube (CRT) in terms of these parameters as well as essy set up techniques. The procedures can be used in the environment where the CRT is used. The procedures are based on a digital representation of the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers pattern plus a few simple other digital patterns. Additionally, measurement techniques are discussed for estimating brightness uniformity, veiling glare, and distortion. Apart from the absolute luminance, all performance features can be assessed with an uncalibrated photodetector and the eyes of a human observer. The measurement techniques especially enable the user to perform comparisons of different display systems. © 1990 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},
